"Dad, I don't want to do maths today!"

"I know mate, I don't want to fuckin' do it either. But I can't let you end up dumb, it's not an option. Just take a look at your Mum and me, you know you're not going to have a career as a model. Everything fuckin' doubles in price every time I turn around, and you seem to need a bloody university degree for an entry-level factory floor job these days.

"Dunno. There's a number in a box, and two circle thingies
