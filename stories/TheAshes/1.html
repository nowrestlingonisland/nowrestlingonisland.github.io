	<h1>The Ashes</h1>

<p>
"Alright you old wanker, no wriggling your way out of this family road trip," said Kelley cheerfully as she placed the cardboard box containing her Dad's ashes on the passenger seat of her Chevy Bel Air and pulled the seatbelt across it to secure it in place. "I know you always hated wearing a seatbelt for some reason, but I'm not having you coming out of your box and getting my car all dusty. It was painful enough cleaning up this ridiculous gas-guzzling piece of shit already, I don't need another gonad ache now."

<p>
Satisfied the ashes weren't going anywhere, Kelley got into the driver's seat, buckled up, donned her mirrored aviators and fired up the car's V8 engine. While it warmed up, she flicked through her phone, trying to find an appropriate road trip soundtrack.

<p>
"Right, let's see if I can find some music that I like and that you don't - that you didn't hate. Don't like my chances, to be honest. Oh, wait on. Back in Black. Some rare neutral ground. Let's fire it up, eh?"

<p>
Back in Black, Australian hard rock band AC/DC's seventh studio album and first after original lead singer Bon Scott's untimely death, opens with the appropriately funereal "Hells Bells". The track begins with the slow, ominous tolling of a two-ton bell, before Angus Young's guitar, dripping with raw, crunchy, distortion, picks out a mournful minor-key dirge. This was just a bit too fucking funereal for Kelley, so she skipped to the more upbeat title track.

<p>
"Back in black, I hit the sack," she sang along as she set off for the motorway, "Doncha know it's good to be back! I got loose! From the noose! Now I ska da be ba da ba dah de!"

<p>
A handful of fishing tinnies bounced around in the slight chop on the Waitematā as she cruised over the harbour bridge, northbound on State Highway One. It was an already-hot February morning and she was going against the glacial flow of southbound traffic, smiling to herself as she contemplated leaving the city for quieter airs while the working masses grudgingly inched their way into town. She cruised past Takapuna without really noticing it, then through Wairau, Sunnynook and Rosedale flashing past clumps of box stores and seas of identical nondescript housing, until the northern suburbia gradually gave way to more bucolic environs, the highway eventually winding its way through paddocks dotted here and there with self-seeded pines, silage ponds and rusty sheds. "Jesus saves - be there for it" implored the writing on the side of one of them.

<p>
Boredom had well and truly set in by the time she joined the crawl of cars through Warkworth. She was briefly tempted by Maccas, but decided no, she'd rather push on.

<p>
Just as she was rolling out of Warkworth, her eyes were drawn to a lone hitchhiker on her side of the road. The hitchhiker had her thumb nonchalantly jutting out, one tanned leg extending from the footpath over the dotted yellow lines as if asserting possession of the road.

<p>
"Get out of my dreams, get into my car," Kelley said to herself as she pulled over with a rumble of roadside gravel.

<p>
"Hello! Thanks for stopping," said the hitchhiker, bending down to look through the passenger’s side window as Kelley leaned over to wind it down.

<p>
"No worries - I know what it’s like to be stuck on the side of a road. Where are you headed?"

<p>
"Oh, just heading north really. I’m flexible - just happy to be taken anywhere along the line."


<p>
"Alright, well, I'm headed north, so jump on in."

<p>
"Wonderful. Ah - I see you have some ... perhaps, precious cargo in the front seat? I will sit in the back then."

<p>
"Oh, shit no! I mean - there's only lap belts in the back, you'd better sit up front to be safe. He - that can go in the boot. We'll chuck your big backpack in there too."

<p>
Kelley popped the boot, and placed the backpack in first, followed by the ashes, which she secured in place by wedging it between two boxes of Steinlager. She shut the boot firmly and hurried back to her seat.

<p>
"My name's Kelley, by the way," said Kelley as she buckled up and pulled the car back into traffic, steadily speeding up as they left town.

<p>
"Pleased to meet you, Kelley. I'm Astrid."

<p>
"Astrid! Love that name. Do I detect a bit of an accent?"

<p>
"Yes, you do. It’s kind of a mongrel accent, really. A mix of German, Swedish, Scottish, and probably some Kiwi now."

<p>
"Wow. You’ve lived in all those places?"

<p>
"Yes. But it wasn’t because I was following some master plan, I just seemed to end up there. Life just happens, sometimes."

<p>
"I hear ya. Feel the same myself sometimes."

<p>
"Oh, yes? You also moved around a lot?"

<p>
"Yeah. Dad - him in the back - worked in forestry, and when I was a kid he seemed to take us to a different town every couple of years."

<p>
Astrid glanced at the back seat, looking confused.

<p>
"You say your Dad is in the back?"

<p>
"Yeah. Oh right! Not him, his ashes. That's what was in your seat before."

<p>
"Aah, I see. Now it makes sense. But I feel bad - surely he should be here, not me?"

<p>
  "No, no. First off, it's not him, it's just some ashes. I can assure you, we're not going to hurt the ashes' feelings. Second, he would relegate me to the back seat for almost anything: his work gear, his drunk mates, some shit he found on the side of the road. It actually feels good to send him to the back for once. Hold on,” Kelley said as they approached a campervan struggling up a steep gradient, “I'll just overtake these fullas."
  
<p>
Kelley nudged the Bel Air into a lower gear and gunned it, gaining momentum as she bore down on the puttering campervan, then swept past in a roar of pumping cylinders.

<p>
"Wow!" said Astrid as Kelley eased the car back to cruising speed, "this car is really something! And you know how to use it. Where did you get it from?"

<p>
"It used to be Dad's. I got it when he died."

<p>
"Ah, so he left his pride and joy to you?"

<p>
"God no, he wasn’t considerate enough to have a will. The car was a mess, nobody else wanted it."

<p>  
"It's nice to have these reminders of our loved ones though. In a way I suppose it will always be his car."

<p>
"Nah, he's dead. It's my car now. Honestly, it's just a car. It doesn't mean anything."

<p>
"It's true. Not all possessions carry this weight of meaning," Astrid nodded. After a moment of thought she sighed, and turned to Kelley. "I'm sorry, I've been making assumptions about things I know nothing about. You've been very generous by picking me up, and I shouldn't pry so much."

<p>  
"Oh, nah, nah. You're all good! They're all natural questions to ask. You never know with people's family relationships, eh? Some are all peachy and some are all fucked up. Anyway, it'll bore my tits off if we have to stick to safe topics."

<p>
"OK, good. I was worried I had overstepped the line." Astrid stared out of her window for a while, tapping her fingers on the passenger door armrest, before turning back to Kelley. "Since I'm being forward anyway, perhaps I can ask you a favour. And of course, please say no unless you are totally convinced."

<p>
"Shoot."

<p>
"There's a short walk I've been wanting to do up ahead in Dome Valley. Of course I understand if you want to stick to your schedule. But I thought a walk in the bush might make a nice little break."

<p>
"Sounds good to me. Good to stretch the legs now and then."

<p>
"Fantastic! The entrance is soon, just at the top of - ah, there it is."

<p>
Kelley pulled into the gravel carpark and parked in the shade of a grimy Mazda Bongo van. Astrid grabbed her small day pack that had been at her feet, and they walked through the carpark to the start of the track. 

<p>
As soon as the track entered the bush, it started climbing sharply. Kelley, unused to uphill walking, quickly fell in behind Astrid. This also allowed her to admire Astrid's clearly defined calf and thigh muscles, which by appearances seemed well used to covering long distances. Astrid was wearing khaki shorts and a grey marl t-shirt, no doubt made of the highest quality technical hiking fabric yet having the effect of giving her a slightly unflattering cliched outdoorsy tourist look. This didn't stop Kelley from imagining the glutes hidden therein.

<p>
"Like two ferrets fighting in a sack," she muttered to herself.

<p>
After a couple of minutes, they reached a large tōtara. Astrid came to an abrupt stop and raised a finger to her lips, indicating silence.

<p>
"Watch," she whispered, before unslinging her day pack and producing from it a glass jar and a small chunk of polystyrene. Keeley's mind boggled briefly at what this could be for, before Astrid showed her by scraping the polystyrene against the glass, producing a shrill squeak. Almost immediately, a small, hoppy bird flitted down and alighted on a small branch in front of them, chirping brightly.

<p>
"A pīwakawaka. They come to investigate the sound," Astrid explained.

<p>
"Wow, neat trick. Where'd you learn that?"

<p>
"I used to date an ornithologist. Beautiful creatures, birds. As was she. Far too beautiful for me, I'm afraid to say."

<p>
"Really? Surely you're selling yourself short. You're hot as, if you ask me."

<p>
"Well, thank you." Astrid smiled, before turning back to the bird which had been joined by another of the same species. "Two pīwakawaka, now. Chances are, they will follow us. They say this is because they hope our footsteps will disturb the leaf litter and reveal a tasty insect for them to eat, but in this case I'd like to think it's actually because we are both 'hot as' and they just can't resist."

<p>
They stood for a while and watched the two birds flitting and chirping, before Keeley glanced at her Casio F-91W and noticed the time.

<p>
"Hey, maybe we should head back to the car. Don't want to let the day get away on us."

<p>
"Of course. We have bathed in nature, now let's return."

<p>
"Sweet. Lead on."

<p>
"Oh no, you go first. It's my turn to bring up the rear."

<p>
Astrid gave the subtlest of smiles, and Keeley could swear there was a hint of a raised eyebrow.

<p>
"Alright." Keeley smiled before turning to wander back down the track.

<p>
As predicted, the two pīwakawaka followed them for some distance, before losing interest one by one, leaving them alone again. They made faster time on the downhill trip back to the car, only to find the Bongo van had disappeared leaving the Bel Air in full sweltering sun. They wound their windows down before heading back on the road, both hanging a forearm over the door trucker-style to catch a cooling breeze.

<p>
"Ah, shit." Keeley looked down at the dash, concerned.

<p>
"Something wrong?"

<p>
"No, no. Just checking the petrol situation. The fuel gauge is a bit fucked, tends to go up and down like a bride's nightie - I thought we might be running low, but I think it was just following a dip in the road."

<p>
"Up and down like a bride's nightie," Astrid giggled. "Where did you learn such language?"

<p>
"Mainly from my Dad bringing me to the post-game pissup at the rugby club. They think the kids aren't listening, but oh boy, we were."

<p>
"I see. So you went to watch him play a lot?"

<p>
"Worse: he made me play. I never saw him play, he was long retired by the time I came along. Supposedly he'd had career-ending injuries. So, I guess he tried to live his dream out vicariously through me. I was the only girl playing back then, so I had to play on the boys teams. Turned out I was big for my age - thanks to a touch of Tongan on my Mum's side - and unfortunately for me I was a decent enough player. Dad reckoned I could play rep, if I wanted to."

<p>
"But you didn't want to?"

<p>
"Nah. I prefer golf. No teammates to fuck it up. Just you, the ball, and the hole."

<p>
"Ah, it sounds sort of Zen. I'd love to be able to play."

<p>
"You should try! I mean, seriously - I'd be happy to give you a lesson... if the chance came up."

<p>
"Oh, I'd love to, but it sounds so hard. Hitting the ball into such a tiny hole, so far away."

<p>
"Well, we'd start off easy. Just head to the driving range, and hit balls out into the green yonder. Take the hole out of the equation."

<p>
"And bring it back in later."

<p>
"If you play your cards right." Kelley coughed awkwardly, and decided to quickly change the subject rather than see how the line had landed. "Anyway, the plan is to take Dad's ashes up to the Kamo rugby club. That's where he played, back in the day. Figured that's where he'd want to be laid to rest."

<p>
"Oh, good idea. He must have talked about that place a lot."

<p>
"Oh yeah, he'd chew your ear off given a chance. The number of times he told me about the time he came off the bench and kicked the winning conversion in the Northland club final. The way he told it, it was pure drama. There were seconds on the clock, Ian Jones had just scored a try in the corner and was breathing down his neck not to fuck it up, and he ... well, you get the idea, obviously he drills the kick and dines out on it for the rest of his days, boring the rest of his family shitless."

<p>
"Well, I think it is a lovely thing. These sorts of ceremonies can give a sense of closure."

<p>
"Fuckin' hope so. Anyway, where are you headed?"

<p>
"I don't know," Astrid sighed. "Sometimes life is just too organised, and I just want to go where the wind takes me."

<p>
"Fair enough. Well, right now the wind is taking you to Kamo, and I'll be honest with you, it isn't the most glamorous destination. I'd be happy to drop you off somewhere else."

<p>
"Perhaps you're right," Astrid smiled. "There is a hostel I've stayed at before near the Whangarei falls, on Ngunguru road. Could you drop me there? It's quite close to Kamo, I think."

<p>
"Of course, no trouble. No trouble at all."

<p>
With the next steps of the intinerary decided, they settled into a slightly sombre silence. Kelley racked her brains for a way to restart the conversation, but talk of destinations had hung too heavy a pall to lift. They ascended the Brynderwyns quietly, were wordless for the fleeting moment at the summit when Bream Bay suddenly appears, stretching out into the hazy distance, before disappearing as the road drops down steeply to the long, monotonous straights of the south of Whangarei district. All too soon, Kelley found herself rolling through the suburbs of Whangarei city, and in next to no time she was pulling in to the Whangarei Falls Holiday Park and YHA.

<p>
"Well, here we are," Kelley said as she cut the engine. "I'll help you get your bag from the back."

<p>
"Thank you. And your precious cargo can come back to the front."

<p>
"Sorry? Oh right, the ashes."

<p>
They walked to the boot and Keeley handed Astrid her backpack, before returning the ashes to the front seat, a mournfulness descending on her for the first time. She gave them a pat before turning round to farewell Atrid, who she found standing behind her holding out a piece of paper.

<p>
"Here's my number. If you need to talk. I hardly know you, but this can be a tough time emotionally and sometimes a neutral ear can be helpful."

<p>
Keeley took the paper and blinked at the neatly written telephone number on it.

<p>
"Thanks. I might just take you up on that."

<p>
"Please do. Oh, and I'd still love you to give me that golf lesson. Or," Astrid said as she slung her backpack over her shoulders, "you could just take me out for a drink."

<p>
She smiled, winked, and, before Kelley could reply, turned and walked off. Keeley watched her for a moment before hopping back into the drivers seat.

<p>
"Well Dad," she said as she drove slowly to the Kamo rugby club, "looks like you might have finally come through for me with one helluva post-death wingman job."

<p>
The rugby club carpark was empty when she arrived. She released the seatbelt protecting the ashes, and tucked them under her arm before heading towards the playing field. At one end a few kids were practicing kicking goals, and duffing them from hilariously short range. She wandered onto the field, hoping for an auspicious ashes-scattering spot to make itself obvious. Inspiration failed to strike, so she stood for a moment, eyes closed, hoping for the moment to speak for itself.

<p>
"Fuckin' kick it cunt, stop wasting time!"

<p>
Kelley snapped out of her reverie, and walked towards the end of the field where the kids were bickering over getting their turn to kick. As soon as they saw her coming, they fell quiet and stood stock still.

<p>
"Hi kids!" she said in her friendliest voice. "Kicking some goals, eh?"

<p>
The kids shot stares at each other, until presumably the oldest piped up:

<p>
"Yes, miss."

<p>
"Mind if I have a go?"

<p>
The oldest nodded, and a smaller girl dutifully scampered over to Kelley with the ball and an orange plastic kicking tee.

<p>
"Ta. Won't be needing this," Kelley said, tossing the kicking tee aside, "I'm gonna do it old school like my Dad used to. He’d kick it off a mound of sand."

<p>
Kelley kneeled and emptied the ashes onto the ground, shaping them into a conical mound.

<p>
"Is that sand, miss?"

<p>
"Something like that."

<p>
Kelley nestled the ball on top of the ash mound, angling the seam toward her target. Standing up, she took three steps backward and two sideways, before studying the ball, then the goalposts, then the ball again. Instinct took over, and she approached then struck the ball cleanly, sending it between the sticks in a billowing dust cloud.

<p>
The kids whooped and cheered as Kelley turned her back on the settling ashes and walked back to her car. She opened the boot and grabbed a Steinlager, which she opened on another Steinlager, before driving off into the hot, slow afternoon.
