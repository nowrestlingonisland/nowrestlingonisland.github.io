	<h1>The Ashes</h1>

<p>
"Alright you old wanker, no wriggling your way out of this family road trip," said Keeley cheerfully as she placed the cardboard box containing her Dad's ashes on the passenger seat of her Chevy Bel Air and pulled the seatbelt across it to secure it in place. "I know you always hated wearing a seatbelt for some reason, but I'm not having you coming out of your box and getting my car all dusty. It was painful enough cleaning up this ridiculous gas-guzzling piece of shit already, I don't need another gonad ache now."

<p>
Satisfied the ashes weren't going anywhere, Keeley got into the driver's seat, buckled up, donned her mirrored aviators and fired up the car's V8 engine. While it warmed up, she flicked through her phone, trying to find an appropriate road trip soundtrack.

<p>
"Right, let's see if I can find some music that I like and that you don't - that you didn't hate. Don't like my chances, to be honest. Oh, wait on. Back in Black. Some rare neutral ground. Let's fire it up, eh?"

<p>
Back in Black, Australian hard rock band AC/DC's seventh studio album and first after original lead singer Bon Scott's untimely death, opens with the appropriately funereal "Hells Bells". The track begins with the slow, ominous tolling of a two-ton bell, before Angus Young's guitar, dripping with raw, crunchy, distortion, picks out a mournful minor-key dirge. This was just a bit too fucking funereal for Keeley, so she skipped to the more upbeat title track.

<p>
"Back in black, I hit the sack," she sang along as she set off for the motorway, "Doncha know it's good to be back! I got loose! From the noose! Now I ska da be ba da ba dah de!"

<p>
A handful of fishing tinnies bounced around in the slight chop on the Waitematā as she cruised over the harbour bridge, northbound on State Highway One. It was an already-hot February morning and she was going against the glacial flow of southbound traffic, smiling to herself as she contemplated leaving the city for quieter airs while the working masses grudgingly inched their way into town. She cruised past Takapuna without really noticing it, then through Wairau, Sunnynook and Rosedale without really taking in the clumps of box stores and seas of identical nondescript housing, until the northern suburbia gradually gave way to more bucolic environs, with the highway eventually winding its way through paddocks dotted here and there with self-seeded pines, silage ponds and rusty sheds. "Jesus saves - be there for it" implored the writing on the side of one of them.

<p>
Boredom had well and truly set in by the time she joined the crawl of cars through Warkworth. The fuel gauge was hard to read, bouncing up and down with every lump in the road, but she knew the V8 could be especially thirsty on a hot day like this. She considered stopping for petrol, but decided no, she'd rather push on and fill up somewhere a bit more scenic.

<p>
Just as she was rolling out of Warkworth, her eyes were drawn to a lone hitchhiker on her side of the road. The hitchhiker had her thumb confidently extended at the end of a nonchalantly extended arm, one tanned leg angled toward the road as if staking a claim of possession of the prime hitchhiking spot.

<p>
"Get out of my dreams, get into my car," Keeley said to herself as she pulled over beside the hitchhiker. She leaned over and wound the passenger window down. The hichhiker walked over, leaned down and poked her head just inside the window.

<p>
"Hello! Thanks for stopping."

<p>
"No worries. I've done my fair share of hitchhiking so I know what it's like to be stuck on the side of the road. Where are you headed?"

<p>
"Oh, just heading north really. I don't have any firm plan or schedule or anything. I'm just happy to be taken anywhere along the line."

<p>
"Alright, well, I'm headed north, so jump on in."

<p>
"Wonderful. Ah - I see you have some ... perhaps, precious cargo in the front seat? I will sit in the back then."

<p>
"Oh, shit no! I mean - there's only lap belts in the back, you'd better sit up front to be safe. He - that can go in the boot. We'll chuck your big backpack in there too."

<p>
Jamie popped the boot, and placed the backpack in first, followed by the ashes, which she secured in place by wedging it between two boxes of Steinlager. She shut the boot firmly and hurried back to her seat. The two of them buckled up and they headed back onto the road.

"Ah - my name's Keeley, by the way."

"Pleased to meet you, Keeley. I'm Amstrid."

"Astrid! Love that name. Do I detect a bit of an accent?"

"Yes, you do. I have one of those accents that are hard to place - well, I'm a little hard to place myself. I grew up between Hong Kong and Germany, went to university in Scotland, began my career in Australia, and recently ended up here - well, I say recently, but actually it has been nearly ten years."

"Wow. You relly have been everywhere."

"Yes, and mostly not according to any real plan. Things just seemed to happen, regardless of whatever expectations I had in my head."

"I hear ya. Feel the same myself sometimes."

"Yes?"

"Yeah."

"OK, you have to tell me more now. You also moved around a lot?"

"Yeah, have done. Dad - him in the back - worked in forestry, and when I was a kid he seemed to take us all to a different town every couple of years."

Astrid glanced at the back seat, looking confused.

"You say your Dad is in the back?"

"Yeah. Oh right! Not him, his ashes. That's what was in your seat before."

"Aah, I see. Now it makes sense. But now I'm feeling bad. Surely he should be here, not me?"

"No, no. First off, it's not him, it's just some ashes. I can assure you, we're not going to hurt the ashes' feelings. Second, he would relegate me to the back seat for almost anything: his work gear, his drunk mates, some busted shit he found on the side of the road. It actually feels good to send him to the back for once. Hold on, I'm just going to overtake this campervan."

Keeley nudged the Bel Air into a lower gear and gunned it, gaining momentum as she approached the rental capervan vainly struggling uphill, then swung it out into the oncoming lane and swept past in a roar of pumping cylinders.

"Wow!" said Astrid as Keeley eased off and let the car coast back to cruising speed, "this car is really something! And you know how to use it. Where did you get it from?"

"It used to be Dad's. I got it when he died."

"Ah, so he left his pride and joy to you?"

"Nah - he never took care of it, and nobody else in the family wanted it."

"It's nice to have these reminders of our loved ones though. In a way I suppose it will always be his car."

"Nah, he's dead. It's my car now. Honestly, it's just a car. It doesn't mean anything."

"It's true. Not all possessions carry this weight of meaning." Astrid turned to look out the window, nodding. After a moment of thought she sighed, and turned back to Keeley. "I'm sorry, I've been making assumptions about things I know nothing about. You've been very generous by picking me up, and I shouldn't pry so much."

"Oh, nah, nah. You're all good! They're all natural questions to ask. You never know with people's family relationships, eh? Some are all peachy and some are all fucked up. Anyway, it'll bore my tits off if we stick to boring, uncontroversial stuff."

"OK, good. I was worried I had overstepped the line." Astrid stared out of her window for a while, tapping her fingers on the passenger door armrest, before turning back to Keeley. "Since I'm being forward anyway, perhaps I can ask you a favour. And of course, please say no unless you are totally convinced."

"Shoot."

"There's a short walk I've been wanting to do up ahead in Dome Valley. Of course I understand if you want to stick to your schedule. But I thought a walk in the bush might make a nice little break."

"Sounds good to me. Good to stretch the legs now and then."

"Fantastic! The entrance is soon, just at the top of - ah, there it is."

Keeley pulled into the gravel carpark and parked in the shade of a grimy Mazda Bongo van. Astrid grabbed her small day pack that had been at her feet, and the two walked past the Dome tea rooms and on to the start of the track. As soon as the track entered the bush, it started climbing sharply. Keeley, unused to uphill walking, quickly fell in behind Astrid. This also allowed her to admire Astrid's clearly defined calf and thigh muscles, seemingly used to covering long distances. Astrid was wearing khaki shorts and grey marl t-shirt, no doubt made of the highest quality technical hiking fabric yet having the effect of making her indistinguishable from a whole class of outdoorsish touristy types. This didn't stop Keeley from imagining the glutes hidden therein.

"Like two ferrets fighting in a sack," she muttered to herself.

After a couple of minutes, they reached a large tōtara. Astrid came to an abrupt stop and raised a finger to her lips, indicating silence.

"Watch," she whispered, before unslinging her day pack and producing from it a glass jar and a small chunk of polystyrene. Keeley's mind boggled briefly at what this could be for, before Astrid showed her by scraping the polystyrene against the glass, producing a shrill squeak. Almost immediately, a small, hoppy bird flitted down and alighted on a small branch in front of them, chirping brightly.

"They come to investigate the sound," Astrid explained.

"Wow, neat trick. Where'd you learn that?"

"I used to date an ornithologist. Beautiful creatures, birds. As was she. Far too beautiful for me, I'm afraid to say."

"Really? Surely you're selling yourself short. You're a total stunner, if you ask me."

"Well, thank you." Astrid smiled, before turning back to the bird which had been joined by another of the same species. "Two pīwakawaka, now. Chances are, they will follow us. They say this is because they hope our footsteps will disturb the leaf litter and reveal a tasty insect for them to eat, but in this case I'd like to think it's actually because we are two stunners and they just can't resist."

They stood for a while and watched the two birds flitting and chirping, before Keeley glanced at her Casio F-91W and noticed the time.

"Hey, maybe we should head back to the car. Don't want to let the day get away on us."

"Of course. We have bathed in nature, now let's return."

"Sweet. Lead on."

"Oh no, you go first. It's my turn to bring up the rear."

Astrid gave the subtlest of smiles, and Keeley could swear there was a hint of a raised eyebrow.

"Alright." Keeley smiled before turning to wander back down the track.

As predicted, the two pīwakawaka followed them for some distance, before losing interest one by one, leaving them alone again. They made faster time on the downhill trip back to the car, only to find the Bongo van had disappeared leaving the Bel Air in full sweltering sun. They wound their windows down before heading back on the road, both hanging a forearm over the door trucker-style to catch a cooling breeze.

"Ah, shit." Keeley looked down at the dash, concerned.

"Something wrong?"

"No, no. Just checking the petrol situation. The fuel gauge is a bit fucked, tends to go up and down like a bride's nightie - I thought we might be running low, but I think it was just following a dip in the road."

"Up and down like a bride's nightie," Astrid giggled. "Where did you learn such language?"

"Mainly from my Dad bringing me to the post-game pissup at the rugby club. They think the kids aren't listening, but oh boy, we were."

"I see. So you went to watch him play a lot?"

"Worse: he made me play. I never actually saw him play. Supposedly he'd had career-ending injuries. So, I guess he tried to live his dream out vicariously through me. I was the only girl playing back then, so I had to play on the boys teams. Turned out I was big for my age - thanks to a touch of Tongan on my Mum's side - and unfortunately for me I was a decent enough player. Dad reckoned I could play rep, if I wanted to."

"But you didn't want to?"

"Nah. I prefer golf. No teammates to fuck it up. Just you, the ball, and the hole."

"Ah, it sounds sort of Zen. I'd love to be able to play."

"You should try! I mean, seriously - I'd be happy to give you a lesson... if the chance came up."

"Oh, I'd love to, but it sounds so hard. Hitting the ball into such a tiny hole, so far away."

"Well, we'd start off easy. Just head to the driving range, and hit balls out into the green yonder. Take the hole out of the equation."

"And bring it back in later."

"If you play your cards right." Keeley coughed awkwardly. "Anyway, the plan is to take Dad's ashes up to the Kamo rugby club. That's where he played, back in the day. Figured that's where he'd want to be laid to rest."

"Ah, so they're OK with you scattering the ashes there?"

"Er ... I hadn't actually asked, to be honest. Are you supposed to get permission or something?"

"Oh no, I'm sure nobody will notice anyway. It's probably good for the grass. He must have talked about that place a lot."

"Oh yeah, he'd chew your ear off given a chance. The number of times he told me about coming off the bench to kick the winning conversion in the Northland club final. The way he told it, there were seconds on the clock, Ian Jones had just scored a try in the corner and was breathing down his neck not to fuck it up, and he ... well, you get the idea, obviously he drills the kick and dines out on it for the rest of his days, driving his kids spare."

"Well, I think it is a lovely thing. These sorts of ceremonies can give a sense of closure."

"Fuckin' hope so. Anyway, where are you headed?"

"I don't know," Astrid sighed. "Sometimes life is just too organised, and I just want to go where the wind takes me."

"Fair enough. Well, right now the wind is taking you to Kamo, and I'll be honest with you, it isn't the most glamorous destination. I'm happy to drop you anywhere else."

"Perhaps you're right," Astrid smiled. "There is a hostel I've stayed at before near the Whangarei falls, on Ngunguru road. Could you drop me there? It's quite close to Kamo, I think."

"Of course, no trouble. No trouble at all."

They settled into a silence as a slight drizzle started to fall. Keeley racked her brains for a way to restart the conversation, but talk of final destinations had hung too heavy a pall to lift. They ascended the Brynderwyns quietly, silently took in the moment at the highest point when Bream Bay stretches before you, before dropping down to the long, straight time-bending runs of road of the south of Whangarei district, and crawling through the suburban agglomeration of Whangarei city, reaching the Whangarei Falls Holiday Park and YHA all too soon.

"Well, here we are," Keeley said as she cut the engine. "I'll help you get your bag from the back."

"Thank you. And your precious cargo can come back to the front."

"Sorry? Oh right, the ashes."

They walked to the boot and Keeley handed Astrid her backpack, before returning the ashes to the front seat, a mournfulness descending on her for the first time. She gave them a pat before turning round to farewell Atrid, who she found standing behind her holding out a piece of paper.

"Here's my number. If you need to talk. I hardly know you, but this can be a tough time emotionally and sometimes a neutral ear can be helpful."

Keeley took the paper and blinked at the neatly written telephone number on it.

"Thanks. I might just take you up on that."

"Please do. Oh, and I'd still love you to give me that golf lesson. Or," Astrid said as she slung her backpack over her shoulders, "you could just take me out for a drink."

She smiled, winked, and, before Keeley could reply, turned and walked off. Keeley watched her for a moment before hopping back into the drivers seat.

"Well Dad," she said as she drove slowly to the Kamo rugby club, "looks like you might have finally come through for me with one helluva post-death wingman job."

The carpark was empty when she arrived. She released the seatbelt protecting the ashes, and tucked them under her arm before heading towards the playing field. At one end a few kids were practicing kicking goals, and failing from hilariously short range. She wandered onto the field, hoping for an auspicious ashes-scattering spot to make itself obvious. Inspiration failing to strike, she stood for a moment, eyes closed, hoping for the moment to speak for itself.

"Fuckin' kick it cunt, stop wasting time!"

Keeley snapped out of her reverie, and walked towards the end of the field where the kids were bickering over getting their turn to goal. As soon as they saw her coming, the fell quiet and stood stock still.

"Hi kids!" she said in her friendliest voice. "Kicking some goals, eh?"

The kids shot stares at each other, until presumably the oldest piped up:

"Yes, miss."

"Mind if I have a go?"

The oldest nodded, and a smaller girl dutifully grabbed the ball and the orange plastic kicking tee and scampered over to Keeley with them.

"Ta. Won't be needing this," Keeley said, tossing the kicking tee aside, "I'm gonna do it old school like my Dad used to, kicking off a mound of sand."

Keeley kneeled and emptied the ashes onto the ground, shaping them into a conical mound.

"Is that sand, miss?"

"Something like that."

Keeley nestled the ball on top of the ash mound, angling the seam toward her target. She stood and took three steps backward and two sideways, before studying the ball, then the goalposts, then the ball again. Instinct took over, and she approached then struck the ball cleanly, sending it between the sticks in a billowing dust cloud.

The kids whooped and cheered as Keeley turned her back on the settling ashes and walked back to her car. She opened the boot and grabbed a Steinlager, which she opened on another Steinlager, before driving off into the evening.
