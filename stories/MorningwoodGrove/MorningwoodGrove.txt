Morningwood Grove
===============


Dawn cracked over Morningwood Grove. I woke up feeling dustier than my Nana’s Princess Di memorial dinner plate set, and my head was throbbing in an entirely different way than it usually did on a Sunday morning. I managed to slowly ratchet myself into a seated position in bed and looked around groggily. At the end of the bed, Benji Marshall’s face stared at me from my poster from the 2010 Kiwi Rugby League Four Nations campaign. This at least reassured me that I’d made it back to my own room, though the serious look on Benji’s face suddenly made it seem like he was judging me.

“Look at the state of you,” he seemed to say.

“Yeah, yeah. I know, Benji.”

“You were a promising halfback in Year 10. Now look what you’re doing with yourself.”

“Jeez Benji, give us a break-”

“On the dole. Out on the piss as soon as your Winz comes through. Bet you don’t even remember where you got those fishnets you’re wearing.”

“Eh?” I pulled the duvet off my legs. Fuck me. I *was* wearing fishnets. “How...?”

I abandoned the question and instead stumbled out of bed, where I promptly fell over a pair of hot pink stilettos, men’s size 13, left beside my bed.

“You think that’s something, go look at your face in the mirror.”

My face? I looked up at Benji. He stared back at me, still inscrutable. Oh Jesus, I’d better go and look in a mirror, I thought. 

I shambled out of my bedroom, barely registering the hot pink mini-skirt dress lying on the floor, stumbled into the hall, and made my way into the bathroom. As soon as I saw myself in the mirror I gave a high pitched yelp. My face was heavily caked with makeup, with my lips thickly slathered with hot pink lipstick (matching the shoes and dress), and clearly showing through even that much makeup was a real mean-as black eye.

“You alright?” asked my Mum as she walked into the bathroom, no doubt wondering why I’d squealed like an eight-year-old who’d been surprised by a handsy clown. “Oh, god! How did you get that shiner?”

“I dunno,” I moaned. “Can’t remember a thing.”

“Cold cream’s in the cupboard under the sink. You’ll need it for all that makeup. I’ll get some frozen peas for your eye.” She walked off to the kitchen, calling back after herself: “What size are the fishnets?”

“I dunno!” I yelled back. “I told you I can’t remember a fucking thing.”

After cleaning off the makeup (which was quite skillfully applied, suggesting someone else had done it for me) and slapping the tea towel-wrapped frozen peas Mum had handed me over my throbbing eye, I headed back to my room to try and find my phone and see if it could help me piece together what the fuck had happened to me last night. I picked up the pink dress that I had presumably been wearing from my bedroom floor and inspected it for any kind of pocket a phone could be stashed in. There was no way anyone was carrying a phone in *that* tiny piece of fabric. I groggily searched around the rest of the room, but there was no sign of it. As I searched I carefully avoided catching Benji’s eye in case he admonished me again. I finally got the courage to look up at him, half expecting to be given a spray, but apparently he’d said enough already.

I gave up the search and instead changed into my normal clothes and went to find Mum.

“Mum!” I yelled. “Can you call my phone?”

I found her in the kitchen making coffee, phone to her ear.

“Can you call my phone?”

“Yes, I heard you, I’m calling it. I don’t know why you yell so loud, I’m on the other side of the house, not in bloody Huntly.” She tapped her fingers on the kitchen bench. “Straight to voicemail.”

“Fuck.” I slumped into a chair at the dining table.

“What’s the last thing you remember?” prodded Mum, going back to making coffee.

“Um...” I thought carefully, trying to remember something, anything about yesterday. “Well, I went to Jase’s to drop back his fishing rod.”

“Well, why don’t you call him and ask what you did next?”

“Can’t find my phone.”

“Call him on mine.” She offered her phone.

“But I don’t know his number.”

“His number’s on there.”

“Eh? You’ve got Jase’s number on your phone?”

She said nothing, just held the phone out. I stared for a moment, but my desire to find out what happened last night outweighed my misgivings at how Jase ended up in Mum’s phone, so I took the phone and called him.

“Hey, Mrs T!”

“Jase, it’s me. Kev.”

“Ah, Kev! I’ve been trying to call you all morning. Why don’t you answer your phone?”

“Can’t find it.”

“Ah yeah, figures. You seemed in a phone-losing kind of state last night. But bro, I really, really need to tell you all about what happened.”

“Go on,” I sighed, rubbing my temple. I went to the lounge - who knows what dodgy shit would come up in this conversation, better not risk my Mum hearing anything.

“OK, get this.
