Morningwood Grove
===============


Dawn cracked over Morningwood Grove. I woke up feeling dustier than my Nana’s Princess Di memorial dinner plate set, and my head was throbbing in an entirely different way than it usually did on a Sunday morning. I managed to slowly ratchet myself into a seated position in bed and looked around groggily. At the end of the bed, Benji Marshall’s face stared at me from my poster from the 2010 Kiwi Rugby League Four Nations campaign. This at least reassured me that I’d made it back to my own room, though the serious look on Benji’s face suddenly made it seem like he was judging me.

“Look at the state of you,” he seemed to say.

“Yeah, yeah. I know, Benji.”

“You were a promising halfback in Year 10. Now look what you’re doing with yourself.”

“Jeez Benji, give us a break-”

“On the dole. Out on the piss as soon as your Winz comes through. Bet you don’t even remember where you got those fishnets you’re wearing.”

“Eh?” I pulled the duvet off my legs. Fuck me. I *was* wearing fishnets. “How...?”

I abandoned the question and instead stumbled out of bed, where I promptly fell over a pair of hot pink stilettos, men’s size 13, left beside my bed.

“You think that’s something, go look at your face in the mirror.”

My face? I looked up at Benji. He stared back at me, still inscrutable. Oh Jesus, I’d better go and look in a mirror, I thought. 

I shambled out of my bedroom, barely registering the hot pink mini-skirt dress lying on the floor, stumbled into the hall, and made my way into the bathroom. As soon as I saw myself in the mirror I gave a high pitched yelp. My face was heavily caked with makeup, with my lips thickly slathered with hot pink lipstick (matching the shoes and dress), and clearly showing through even that much makeup was a real mean-as black eye.

“You alright?” asked my Mum as she walked into the bathroom, no doubt wondering why I’d squealed like an eight-year-old who’d been surprised by a handsy clown. “Oh, god! How did you get that shiner?”

“I dunno,” I moaned. “Can’t remember a thing.”

“Cold cream’s in the cupboard under the sink. You’ll need it for all that makeup. I’ll get some frozen peas for your eye.” She walked off to the kitchen, calling back after herself: “What size are the fishnets?”

“I dunno!” I yelled back. “I told you I can’t remember a fucking thing.”

After cleaning off the makeup (which was quite skillfully applied, suggesting someone else had done it for me) and slapping the tea towel-wrapped frozen peas Mum had handed me over my throbbing eye, I headed back to my room to try and find my phone and see if it could help me piece together what the fuck had happened to me last night. I picked up the pink dress that I had presumably been wearing from my bedroom floor and inspected it for any kind of pocket a phone could be stashed in. There was no way anyone was carrying a phone in *that* tiny piece of fabric. I groggily searched around the rest of the room, but there was no sign of it. As I searched I carefully avoided catching Benji’s eye in case he admonished me again. I finally got the courage to look up at him, half expecting to be given a spray, but apparently he’d said enough already.

I gave up the search and instead changed into my normal clothes and went to find Mum.

“Mum!” I yelled. “Can you call my phone?”

I found her in the kitchen making coffee, phone to her ear.

“Can you call my phone?”

“Yes, I heard you, I’m calling it. I don’t know why you yell so loud, I’m on the other side of the house, not in bloody Huntly.” She tapped her fingers on the kitchen bench. “Straight to voicemail.”

“Fuck.” I slumped into a chair at the dining table.

“What’s the last thing you remember?” prodded Mum, going back to making coffee.

“Um...” I thought carefully, trying to remember something, anything about yesterday. “Well, I went to Jase’s to drop back his fishing rod.”

“Well, why don’t you call him and ask what you did next?”

“Can’t find my phone.”

“Call him on mine.” She offered her phone.

“But I don’t know his number.”

“His number’s on there.”

“Eh? You’ve got Jase’s number on your phone?”

She said nothing, just held the phone out. I stared for a moment, but my desire to find out what happened last night outweighed my misgivings at how Jase ended up in Mum’s phone, so I took the phone and called him.

“Hey, Mrs T!”

“Jase, it’s me. Kev.”

“Ah, Kev! I’ve been trying to call you all morning. Why don’t you answer your phone?”

“Can’t find it.”

“Ah yeah, figures. You seemed in a phone-losing kind of state last night. But bro, I really, really need to tell you all about what happened.”

“Go on,” I sighed, rubbing my temple. I went to the lounge - who knows what dodgy shit would come up in this conversation, better not risk my Mum hearing anything.

“OK, get this. There’s this hot as older lady in a supermarket, right. Like, total MILF. And she sees the cucumbers, and she just has to start fucking herself with one. Like, she’s that horny, bro. But then, get this: she snaps this dude that works at the supermarket who’s been watching her the whole time. Right?”

“Uh... OK?” I had no clue what the fuck Jase was talking about, and even less clue how to ask him.

“But get this: she’s into it, bro! She calls him over and is like dude, let’s go, and then next thing she’s fully fucking his face, like shoving his tongue on her clit and shit. Bro, it was mean!”

“So wait ... are you telling me that you ... saw this happen?”

“Yeah.”

“Where?”

“Pornhub. Watched it this morning.”

“Pornhub? Oh jesus, you fucking numbnuts. Why the fuck did you think I’d want to hear about your porn watching? You’ve been calling me all morning to tell me *that*?”

“Don’t you get it, bro? The supermarket? I used to work in a supermarket, just like the guy who got to fuck that MILF.”

“Right. So?”

“So, it’s changed my life, bro. That’s what I want to happen to me.”

“*That’s* your life-changing epiphany? Jesus, you really do have shit for brains.”

“Nah man, come on. I used to always see hot-as mums going through the store. I just need to find one that’s a horny-as sexually frustrated single mum type.”

“Are you for real? It’s porn, bro, that shit doesn’t happen in real life.”

“Why not?”

“Right. So you think you’re going to stumble across a hot older lady fucking herself with a cucumber in the middle of the fruit and veg section, in front of all the customers and staff, at a supermarket you don’t even work at any more, and out of everybody she’s going to pick you, the weedy little stoner ex-trolley boy, as her new lover?”

Jase was silent for a moment.

“Look, mate,” he finally said, “you can hate on my dream all you want, but it won’t change anything. I’m going to make it happen.”

“OK, fine, whatever. Look, I need you to help me figure out what happened to me last night. Last thing I remember, I was at your place dropping off your fishing rod.”

“Yeah, then we went down the Thirsty Turtle for a couple of beers.”

“Oh yeah ... I vaguely remember going there. Then what?”

“Then you went for a piss and disappeared for ages, and when you finally came back you were wearing this pink dress, stockings and heels. Bro, the dress was, like, strapless, and you got some hairy-as shoulders. It was crack up.”

“Oh... fuck...”

“Then you were like ‘laters, I’m going to Drexler’s, and you gapped it with these chicks.”

“Oh god ... what the fuck was going on that night? What the fuck was I even doing?”

“I dunno, man. You were leaving a pub with three chicks while wearing a pink dress, stockings and high heels. You do the maths.”

I pondered for a moment where doing the maths might have led Jase, but then remembered his supermarket fantasy and abruptly stopped pondering. Instead I searched my mind for any recollection of these three chicks I’d supposedly gone with to Drexler’s, but I must’ve taken too many left turns and ended up back where I started. I rubbed my temples as if it might clear the murk in my head.

“Jase, those three chicks I left with ... were they ... I dunno, can you remember anything remarkable about them?”

“Nah, bro. Not really.”

“Fuck... I’m never gonna figure out what happened last night.”

“Wait, you really don’t remember anything?”

“Nah.”

“Why don’t you just ask Tilly?”

“Tilly?”

“Yeah. Tilly, from high school. She was one of the three chicks you left with.”

“Fuck, Jase - you said you couldn’t remember anything remarkable about them!”

“Yeah. Nothing remarkable about Tilly. She’s boring as.”

“Jase, you fuckin...” I realised there was no point in remonstrating with him further, so decided to try my best to remain patient. “OK, fine. I guess I have to try and talk to Tilly. You don’t have a number or anything for her, do you?”

“Nah. But you know her Dad, right? Eggy?”

“Eggy.” Oh no.

“Yeah, Eggy. Just go ask him.”

“Yeah. Just go ask Eggy. Thanks, Jase. Just... thanks.”

“Uh ... alright then. You’re welcome? Laters, I guess.”

“Yeah. Laters.”

Just go ask Eggy. This was a problem. Eggy was my old boss, but I hadn’t talked to him since I up and walked out of the shelving warehouse right after smoko one Tuesday and never came back. Just couldn’t handle packing up one more shipment of shelving, ever. Just ghosted the fucker. And now I had to go and ask Eggy if I could talk to his daughter to see if she could tell me why I woke up this morning in full drag with a black eye.

Well, at least that was a problem for Monday. I didn’t have a number for Eggy either, so my only option was to go to the warehouse to talk to him when he was at work. But maybe I could still piece things together without having to go back there.

I went back to my room and made another feeble attempt at finding my phone there, hopeful that it would just magically appear, but no dice. Maybe I left it in one of the pubs I went to last night.

“Mum?” I called as I stomped through the house looking for her.

“Yes?” she called, apparently from her bedroom.

“Can you give me a ride to the Thirsty Turtle?” I asked, stepping through her bedroom door.

“No,” she said, not looking up from the magazine she was reading in bed.

“Why not?”

“I’m busy.”

“Busy doing what?” Silence. “Well, can I borrow the car then?”

“No. Walk.”

“Why can’t I borrow the car?”

More silence. I groaned, and went to get my sunnies, wallet, and keys. Guess I was walking, then.

I shoved the Dirty Dogs onto my face, slipped into my jandals, and stumbled out the front door. The sun wasn’t even that high yet and it was already hotter than a welder’s budgie smugglers. What a fuckin day for walking. Fuck Summer.

By the time I got to the end of Morningwood Grove and out on to Taiawa Street my head was seriously throbbing, so I made a beeline for the Mobil on Moetoa Road to buy a can of coke.

“Sorry bro, insufficient funds,” said the cashier when I tried to pay for it.

“What the fuck? I had two hundred bucks in there yesterday!”

“Big night, eh?”

“Dunno. Can’t remember.”

“Hard. You got a black eye, too?”

“Yep.” I raised the Dogs to reveal my eye, now coming up in a nice blue and black pattern.

“Shit, bro. That sucks. Hold on.” He reached under the counter and came back up with two generic brand ibuprofen in their own snipped-off end of a larger plastic-and-foil package. “Emergency stash. Take it bro, you need it. Just take the coke, too.”

“Are you sure? You won’t get in trouble?”

“Nah. Shrinkage. The boss’ll never notice.”

“Bro. You’re a lifesaver. I owe you one. I’ll get you back, promise.”

I necked the ibus, washed down with the biting cold coke, and continued my painful plod to the Thirsty Turtle. Even if they didn’t have my phone, maybe they could tell me how the fuck I spent two hundred bucks at a place that sells five dollar jugs.

The front deck of the Thirsty Turtle was thronged with a group of blokes who all looked to be in their fifties, all dressed in matching lycra cycling gear that struggled to contain a variety of pot bellies, all drinking beer straight from a jug, and passing around a pack of Benson & Hedges Special Filters like a bunch of fourteen-year-olds who’d craftily pilfered a pack of darts from someone’s Mum’s handbag. I didn’t really want to walk past them as it seemed likely they’d try and get some banter going and I honestly couldn’t be fucked trying to respond to them. I decided the best defence is a good offence, so I steeled myself and prepared an opening line for when I walked past.

“Don’t worry lads, I won’t tell your missuses you’re smoking,” I called out with a smile as I tried to stride purposefully past. There were some laughs and half-hearted attempts at riposte that I felt I could safely ignore and just walk on with a wry smile, but then a voice cut through - a voice I felt like I recognised.

“Kevvey? ‘Sthat you?”

I considered ignoring it, but I wasn’t quite far enough past to pretend I hadn’t heard. I sighed, and slowly turned.

“Yeah?”

“It’s me. Eggy.”

Fuck. Eggy. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

“Oh... hey, Eggy.” I smiled weakly.

“When are you coming back to work, eh?” He cackled at this like it was the greatest joke he’d ever made.

“Yeah, look ... real sorry about that, eh?”

“This guy,” Eggy said, turning to address his mates, “one day, come smoko time, he just disappeared. Never came back.That was two months ago. But don’t worry about it, bro. See you tomorrow morning, eh?” 

He cackled even harder at this, prompting his mates to all have a good laugh too. I shifted uncomfortably on my feet. This was even worse than I thought it possibly could be.

“Uh, look, nice chatting, but I have to-”

“Wait on,” Eggy cut me off, raising his metallic-orange wraparound cycling shades to peer at me more closely. “What happened to your eye?”

“Actually I don’t-”

“Did you get smacked by a coconut?”

“Eh? Nah, I was saying I don’t-”

“Gotta watch out for those coconuts, boy. What did you do, look at one of their missuses or something?” He cackled again, but it seemed his comedic effect was fading for his audience.

“What are you talking about, Eggy,” one of them called out. “You’re a bloody coconut yourself!”

“Yeah, that’s how I know!” 

This set them all off laughing again, for some reason, so I decided I may as well cut my losses and get the fuck out of there before I had to listen to any more shithouse attempts at humour.

“Yeah, well, gotta go inside and see if my phone’s here,” I mumbled through the laughter, and walked off inside.

I was relieved to find that once inside I could barely hear Eggy and his mates and their ridiculous banter. Sweet escape. 

I looked around. There was five-eighths of fuck-all going on. Even the pokies room was dead quiet. Maybe the gambling addicts weren’t out of bed yet.

I walked up to the unattended bar and tapped my fingers on it weakly, hoping a staff member would turn up. For untold, painful seconds I waited, but nobody appeared. I peered around and cleared my throat as loudly as I could, but still nothing.

Suddenly I felt totally fucked, like so tired I couldn’t pull a greased stick out of a dead dog’s arse. All I could do was rest my forehead on the bar, despondent. I stayed there, eyes closed, until I finally made myself muster up the energy and face the world again. As I opened my eyes and raised my head back up, I spotted a plastic tray behind the bar labelled “lost property”.

My phone. Could it be in there?

I perked up a bit and looked around again. Still no sign of any staff anywhere.
