Morningwood Grove
===============


Dawn cracked over Morningwood Grove. I woke up feeling dustier than my Nana’s Princess Di memorial dinner plate set, and my head was throbbing in an entirely different way than it usually did on a Sunday morning. I managed to slowly ratchet myself into a seated position in bed and looked around groggily. At the end of the bed, Benji Marshall’s face stared at me from my poster from the 2010 Kiwi Rugby League Four Nations campaign. This at least reassured me that I’d made it back to my own room, though the serious look on Benji’s face suddenly made it seem like he was judging me.

“Look at the state of you,” he seemed to say.

“Yeah, yeah. I know, Benji.”

“You were a promising halfback in Year 10. Now look what you’re doing with yourself.”

“Jeez Benji, give us a break-”

“On the dole. Out on the piss as soon as your Winz comes through. Bet you don’t even remember where you got those fishnets you’re wearing.”

“Eh?” I pulled the duvet off my legs. Fuck me. I *was* wearing fishnets. “How...?”

I abandoned the question and instead stumbled out of bed, where I promptly fell over a pair of hot pink stilettos, men’s size 13, left beside my bed.

“You think that’s something,” I heard Benji say. “Go look at your face in the mirror.”

My face? I looked up at Benji. He stared back at me, still inscrutable. Oh Jesus, I’d better go and look in a mirror, I thought. 

I shambled out of my bedroom, barely registering the hot pink mini-skirt dress lying on the floor, stumbled into the hall, and made my way into the bathroom. As soon as I saw myself in the mirror I gave a high pitched yelp. My face was heavily caked with makeup, with my lips thickly slathered with hot pink lipstick (matching the shoes and dress), and clearly showing through even that much makeup was a real mean-as black eye.

“You alright?” asked my Mum as she walked into the bathroom, no doubt wondering why I’d squealed like an eight-year-old who’d been surprised by a handsy clown. “Oh, god! How did you get that shiner?”

“I dunno,” I moaned. “Can’t remember a thing.”

“Cold cream’s in the cupboard under the sink. You’ll need it for all that makeup. I’ll get some frozen peas for your eye.” She walked off to the kitchen, calling back after herself: “What size are the fishnets?”

“I dunno!” I yelled back. “I told you I can’t remember a fucking thing.”

After cleaning off the makeup (which was quite skillfully applied, suggesting someone else had done it for me) and slapping the tea towel-wrapped frozen peas Mum had handed me over my throbbing eye, I headed back to my room to try and find my phone and see if it could help me piece together what the fuck had happened to me last night. I picked up the pink dress that I had presumably been wearing from my bedroom floor and inspected it for any kind of pocket a phone could be stashed in. There was no way anyone was carrying a phone in *that* tiny piece of fabric. I groggily searched around the rest of the room, but there was no sign of it. As I searched I carefully avoided catching Benji’s eye in case he admonished me again. I finally got the courage to look up at him, half expecting to be given a spray, but apparently he’d said enough already.

I gave up the search and instead changed into my normal clothes and went to find Mum.

“Mum!” I yelled. “Can you call my phone?”

I found her in the kitchen making coffee, phone to her ear.

“Can you call my phone?”

“Yes, I heard you, I’m calling it. I don’t know why you yell so loud, I’m on the other side of the house, not in bloody Huntly.” She tapped her fingers on the kitchen bench. “Straight to voicemail.”

“Fuck.” I slumped into a chair at the dining table.

“What’s the last thing you remember?” prodded Mum, going back to making coffee.

“Um...” I thought carefully, trying to remember something, anything about yesterday. “Well, I went to Jase’s to drop back his fishing rod.”

“Well, why don’t you call him and ask what you did next?”

“Can’t find my phone.”

“Call him on mine.” She offered her phone.

“But I don’t know his number.”

“His number’s on there.”

“Eh? You’ve got Jase’s number on your phone?”

She said nothing, just held the phone out. I stared for a moment, but my desire to find out what happened last night outweighed my misgivings at how Jase ended up in Mum’s phone, so I took the phone and called him.

“Hey, Mrs T!”

“Jase, it’s me. Kev.”

“Ah, Kev! I’ve been trying to call you all morning. Why don’t you answer your phone?”

“Can’t find it.”

“Ah yeah, figures. You seemed in a phone-losing kind of state last night. But bro, I really, really need to tell you all about what happened.”

“Go on,” I sighed, rubbing my temple. I went to the lounge - who knows what dodgy shit would come up in this conversation, better not risk my Mum hearing anything.

“OK, get this. There’s this hot as older lady in a supermarket, right. Like, total MILF. And she sees the cucumbers, and she just has to start fucking herself with one. Like, she’s that horny, bro. But then, get this: she snaps this dude that works at the supermarket who’s been watching her the whole time. Right?”

“Uh... OK?” I had no clue what the fuck Jase was talking about, and even less clue how to ask him.

“But get this: she’s into it, bro! She calls him over and is like dude, let’s go, and then next thing she’s fully fucking his face, like shoving his tongue on her clit and shit. Bro, it was mean!”

“So wait ... are you telling me that you ... saw this happen?”

“Yeah.”

“Where?”

“Pornhub. Watched it this morning.”

“Pornhub? Oh jesus, you fucking numbnuts. Why the fuck did you think I’d want to hear about your porn watching? You’ve been calling me all morning to tell me *that*?”

“Don’t you get it, bro? The supermarket? I used to work in a supermarket, just like the guy who got to fuck that MILF.”

“Right. So?”

“So, it’s changed my life, bro. That’s what I want to happen to me.”

“*That’s* your life-changing epiphany? Jesus, you really do have shit for brains.”

“Nah man, come on. I used to always see hot-as mums going through the store. I just need to find one that’s a horny-as sexually frustrated single mum type.”

“Are you for real? It’s porn, bro, that shit doesn’t happen in real life.”

“Why not?”

“Right. So you think you’re going to stumble across a hot older lady fucking herself with a cucumber in the middle of the fruit and veg section, in front of all the customers and staff, at a supermarket you don’t even work at any more, and out of everybody she’s going to pick you, the weedy little stoner ex-trolley boy, as her new lover?”

Jase was silent for a moment.

“Look, mate,” he finally said, “you can hate on my dream all you want, but it won’t change anything. I’m going to make it happen.”

“OK, fine, whatever. Look, I need you to help me figure out what happened to me last night. Last thing I remember, I was at your place dropping off your fishing rod.”

“Yeah, then we went down the Thirsty Turtle for a couple of beers.”

“Oh yeah ... I vaguely remember going there. Then what?”

“Then you went for a piss and disappeared for ages, and when you finally came back you were wearing this pink dress, stockings and heels. Bro, the dress was, like, strapless, and you got some hairy-as shoulders. It was crack up.”

“Oh... fuck...”

“Then you were like ‘laters, I’m going to Drexler’s, and you gapped it with these chicks.”

“Oh god ... what the fuck was going on that night? What the fuck was I even doing?”

“I dunno, man. You were leaving a pub with three chicks while wearing a pink dress, stockings and high heels. You do the maths.”

I pondered for a moment where doing the maths might have led Jase, but then remembered his supermarket fantasy and abruptly stopped pondering. Instead I searched my mind for any recollection of these three chicks I’d supposedly gone with to Drexler’s, but I must’ve taken too many left turns and ended up back where I started. I rubbed my temples as if it might clear the murk in my head.

“Jase, those three chicks I left with ... were they ... I dunno, can you remember anything remarkable about them?”

“Nah, bro. Not really.”

“Fuck... I’m never gonna figure out what happened last night.”

“Wait, you really don’t remember anything?”

“Nah.”

“Why don’t you just ask Tilly?”

“Tilly?”

“Yeah. Tilly, from high school. She was one of the three chicks you left with.”

“Fuck, Jase - you said you couldn’t remember anything remarkable about them!”

“Yeah. Nothing remarkable about Tilly. She’s boring as.”

“Jase, you fuckin...” I realised there was no point in remonstrating with him further, so decided to try my best to remain patient. “OK, fine. I guess I have to try and talk to Tilly. You don’t have a number or anything for her, do you?”

“Nah. But you know her Dad, right? Eggy?”

“Eggy.” Oh no.

“Yeah, Eggy. Just go ask him.”

“Yeah. Just go ask Eggy. Thanks, Jase. Just... thanks.”

“Uh ... alright then. You’re welcome? Laters, I guess.”

“Yeah. Laters.”

Just go ask Eggy. This was a problem. Eggy was my old boss, but I hadn’t talked to him since I up and walked out of the shelving warehouse right after smoko one Tuesday and never came back. Just couldn’t handle packing up one more shipment of shelving, ever. Just ghosted the fucker. And now I had to go and ask Eggy if I could talk to his daughter to see if she could tell me why I woke up this morning in full drag with a black eye.

Well, at least that was a problem for Monday. I didn’t have a number for Eggy either, so my only option was to go to the warehouse to talk to him when he was at work. But maybe I could still piece things together without having to go back there.

I went back to my room and made another feeble attempt at finding my phone there, hopeful that it would just magically appear, but no dice. Maybe I left it in one of the pubs I went to last night.

“Mum?” I called as I stomped through the house looking for her.

“Yes?” she called, apparently from her bedroom.

“Can you give me a ride to the Thirsty Turtle?” I asked, stepping through her bedroom door.

“No,” she said, not looking up from the magazine she was reading in bed.

“Why not?”

“I’m busy.”

“Busy doing what?” Silence. “Well, can I borrow the car then?”

“No. Walk.”

“Why can’t I borrow the car?”

More silence. I groaned, and went to get my sunnies, wallet, and keys. Guess I was walking, then.

I shoved the Dirty Dogs onto my face, slipped into my jandals, and stumbled out the front door. The sun wasn’t even that high yet and it was already hotter than a welder’s budgie smugglers. What a fuckin day for walking. Fuck Summer.

By the time I got to the end of Morningwood Grove and out on to Taiawa Street my head was seriously throbbing, so I made a beeline for the Mobil on Moetoa Road to buy a can of coke.

“Sorry bro, insufficient funds,” said the cashier when I tried to pay for it.

“What the fuck? I had two hundred bucks in there yesterday!”

“Big night, eh?”

“Dunno. Can’t remember.”

“Hard. You got a black eye, too?”

“Yep.” I raised the Dogs to reveal my eye, now coming up in a nice blue and black pattern.

“Shit, bro. That sucks. Hold on.” He reached under the counter and came back up with two generic brand ibuprofen in their own snipped-off end of a larger plastic-and-foil package. “Emergency stash. Take it bro, you need it. Just take the coke, too.”

“Are you sure? You won’t get in trouble?”

“Nah. Shrinkage. The boss’ll never notice.”

“Bro. You’re a lifesaver. I owe you one. I’ll get you back, promise.”

I necked the ibus, washed down with the biting cold coke, and continued my painful plod to the Thirsty Turtle. Even if they didn’t have my phone, maybe they could tell me how the fuck I spent two hundred bucks at a place that sells five dollar jugs.

The front deck of the Thirsty Turtle was thronged with a group of blokes who all looked to be in their fifties, all dressed in matching lycra cycling gear that struggled to contain a variety of pot bellies, all drinking beer straight from a jug, and passing around a pack of Benson & Hedges Special Filters like a bunch of fourteen-year-olds who’d craftily pilfered a pack of darts from someone’s Mum’s handbag. I didn’t really want to walk past them as it seemed likely they’d try and get some banter going and I honestly couldn’t be fucked trying to respond to them. I decided the best defence is a good offence, so I steeled myself and prepared an opening line for when I walked past.

“Don’t worry lads, I won’t tell your missuses you’re smoking,” I called out with a smile as I tried to stride purposefully past. There were some laughs and half-hearted attempts at riposte that I felt I could safely ignore and just walk on with a wry smile, but then a voice cut through - a voice I felt like I recognised.

“Kevvey? ‘Sthat you?”

I considered ignoring it, but I wasn’t quite far enough past to pretend I hadn’t heard. I sighed, and slowly turned.

“Yeah?”

“It’s me. Eggy.”

Fuck. Eggy. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

“Oh... hey, Eggy.” I smiled weakly.

“When are you coming back to work, eh?” He cackled at this like it was the greatest joke he’d ever made.

“Yeah, look ... real sorry about that, eh?”

“This guy,” Eggy said, turning to address his mates, “one day, come smoko time, he just disappeared. Never came back.That was two months ago. But don’t worry about it, bro. See you tomorrow morning, eh?” 

He cackled even harder at this, prompting his mates to all have a good laugh too. I shifted uncomfortably on my feet. This was even worse than I thought it possibly could be.

“Uh, look, nice chatting, but I have to-”

“Wait on,” Eggy cut me off, raising his metallic-orange wraparound cycling shades to peer at me more closely. “What happened to your eye?”

“Actually I don’t-”

“Did you get smacked by a coconut?”

“Eh? Nah, I was saying I don’t-”

“Gotta watch out for those coconuts, boy. What did you do, look at one of their missuses or something?” He cackled again, but it seemed his comedic effect was fading for his audience.

“What are you talking about, Eggy,” one of them called out. “You’re a bloody coconut yourself!”

“Yeah, that’s how I know!” 

This set them all off laughing again, for some reason, so I decided I may as well cut my losses and get the fuck out of there before I had to listen to any more shithouse attempts at humour.

“Yeah, well, gotta go inside and see if my phone’s here,” I mumbled through the laughter, and walked off inside.

I was relieved to find that once inside I could barely hear Eggy and his mates and their ridiculous banter. Sweet escape. 

I looked around. There was five-eighths of fuck-all going on. Even the pokies room was dead quiet. Maybe the gambling addicts weren’t out of bed yet.

I walked up to the unattended bar and tapped my fingers on it weakly, hoping a staff member would turn up. For untold, painful seconds I waited, but nobody appeared. I peered around and cleared my throat as loudly as I could, but still nothing.

Suddenly I felt totally fucked, like so tired I couldn’t pull a greased stick out of a dead dog’s arse. All I could do was rest my forehead on the bar, despondent. I stayed there, eyes closed, until I finally made myself muster up the energy and face the world again. As I opened my eyes and raised my head back up, I spotted a plastic tray behind the bar labelled “lost property”.

My phone. Could it be in there?

I perked up a bit and looked around again. Still no sign of any staff anywhere. They might have been lurking around the corner, though, so better to make sure.

“Hello,” I called out in my most quiet, plaintive voice. 

No answer, but I was still unconvinced.

“Hello?” 

This was loader - croaky and unconvincing, but still louder - and, given my current energy levels, I didn’t think I could surpass it for assertiveness.

No response. Do I? The lost property tray was tantalisingly close. I couldn’t help myself but try to lean over the bar and grab at it. The tips of my fingers were close, but I couldn’t quite bridge the gap.

There was only one way. I’d have to go over the bar. I planted my hand on top of the bar, leaned my weight on them, and tried a couple of little test jumps.

“Don’t do it boy!” a voice suddenly boomed from behind me, “your whole life’s ahead of you!”

I whirled around. It was Eggy. As soon as he made eye contact with me, he started giggling.

“Oh, hey Eggy.” I tried my best to muster a smile. “Look, I wasn’t ... it’s just, I think my phone might be over there and...”

Eggy cut his giggles off short suddenly and a serious look settled on his face.

“Hey Kevvey, sorry for ripping into you back there. Just jokes for the boys, eh?”

“Oh, yeah, all good.” I momentarily relaxed at his seemingly apologetic tone, but quickly became apprehensive that another shitty joke was on its way.

“Look,” Eggy said, remaining serious for now, “I don’t blame you for walking out on the job. That job isn’t easy. I’d rather be out fishing, than do that job. Of course I would. But sometimes we got to do what we got to do, right? Kevvey, mate, I still can’t find anyone as good as you for the job. Come back to work, son.  Maybe we can find a way to make the job better for you.”

“Eggy, bro, I appreciate it. But, no thanks. I got other stuff going on.” 

“No you don’t. You’re on the dole.”

I was affronted. How dare he assume I was on the dole? I was, but he had no way of knowing that.

“Eggy, mate, that’s not even-”

“I know what you did last night.”

“You know what I...”

I trailed off, suddenly tongue-tied. My mind raced with possibilities that he might know something compromising.

“You don’t remember what happened, do you?”

“I...”

“Come to the workshop tomorrow morning. Eight AM. I’ll tell you what happened. Including about your phone.”

“Wait - do you have my phone?”

“Eight AM. You’ll see.”

He was already half-way out the door before he finished the sentence, giving me no chance to object. I shrugged and turned back to the bar and the lost property tray behind it, taunting me just out of reach.

I moped around for a minute or two, wondering if a staff member might turn up, but just being there was making my head hurt, coke and ibu notwithstanding, and the whole experience had tired me out so much that I couldn’t muster up the energy to try and get behind the bar, so I gave up and instead made the painful, empty-handed journey home.

Eight AM tomorrow, and Eggy will supposedly tell me everything. Was I really going to go back to the job I walked out on, just to find out why I ended up in women’s clothing after a Saturday night blackout? And, if Eggy wasn’t bullshitting me, and let me tell you he’s not afraid of bullshitting people, but if not, maybe get my phone back? These were the questions I pondered that evening as I sat on my bed, staring vacantly at my Benji Marhsall poster.

“Any advice, Benji?”

“Don’t switch codes. Well, do if the money’s good, but don’t expect to be any good at it.”

“Uh, right, cheers. Any advice relevant to the situation at hand?”

Nothing but the same stoic stare. Don’t switch codes, eh? Maybe I was going to go.

Since I was totally fucked from the night before I ended up having an early night and waking up at seven, and found myself approaching the Pro Shelf (2006) Ltd premises at 7:58 AM, hardly believing I was about to actually walk back to the scene of the crime. But, walk back I did, right in the front door and into Eggy’s office.

“Morning, Eggy.”

Eggy, who had been puzzling over a jumble of crumpled receipts scattered over his desk, looked up, removing his $2 shop reading glasses, and grinned.

“You came.”

“Yeah.”

“Good. Sit, boy, sit.”

I sat down in a chair that looked like someone had set a glitter bomb off on it, only instead of glitter it was sawdust and aluminium shavings. I had a sudden flashback of trying to get that shit out of my clothes at the end of the day when I worked here. Fuck that.

“Kevey, Kevey. I’m glad you came. You want a cup of tea?”

“No thanks.”

“Coffee.”

“Nah... look, Eggy... I came here just because I’m keen to hear what you know about what I did on Saturday, but I”m worried you’re going to try to get me to come back to work here. You’re not going to try to get me to come back to work here, are you?”

“No, no, nothing like that. But - would you?”

“Nah man. I walked out for a reason, y’know?”

“Yeah, I know, I know. It’s OK. Actually, all I wanted is for you to talk to me and my other staff member about why you hated the job so much. Maybe we can try to figure out how to make the job not so shit, eh? Then maybe the next guy will stay.”

“You got someone else to work here?”

“Yeah, new guy. Business is good, we’re actually expanding. After you left, I took him on, but we need someone else too. But nobody we’ve had in has lasted more than a week.”

“How come the new guy’s staying?”

“He’s motivated. Works hard. He’s not scared to work hard for his future, you know? Not like you lazy kiwis.”

“Yeah? Where’s he from?”

“Afghanistan. Came as a refugee.”

“Fuck. No wonder he’s motivated.”

“You know what? Why don’t you come meet him.”

“Eh? Eggy, I -”

It was too late: he had already stood up and was walking out to the workshop floor. I considered staging a sit-in in Eggy’s office, but was worried he’d get distracted and forget I was here, so I grudgingly followed him out. I shivered as I stepped out onto the familiar, traumatic ground of the workshop floor.

On the other side of the workshop floor, a lone figure, presumably the new guy, was straining to push a large cardboard box up to a high shelf, his back turned to us.

“Mo!” Eggy yelled as we arrived. 

Mo clearly hadn’t heard us coming, and he startled at Eggy’s yell. He fumbled the box he was handling and it upended over his head, showering him in plastic shelf brackets, which bounced off him and onto the concrete floor in a cacophony of clickey-clackey sounds echoing throughout the workshop. He muttered something I couldn’t make out as the clattering died down, then looked at us with a clearly forced half-smile and shrugged.

“Eh, sorry Mo,” said Eggy. “Didn’t mean to scare you.”

“Is no problem. Shelf is too high anyway. I clear up soon.”

“OK, good. Anyway, Mo, this is Kevey. He used to work here.”

“Pleased to meet you.” Mo offered a callused hand, with alumnium shaving glinting in the light where they had stuck in the deep crevices of his work-hardened skin.

“Uh, likewise,” I said, leaning over for a brief shake.

“Mo’s a good, hard worker, not like most of those lazy bastards out there on the dole. Sorry Kevey, but .... y’know.” I shrugged. “So Kevey, you can tell me and Mo no: what is it that made you hate the job so much.”

“You really want to know?”

“Yeah. Really.”

“Alright. Well, you work fuckin long days, doing real hard physical stuff, come home fuckin knackered, covered in crap from the workshop, stinking, all you can is eat, fuckin zombie out on your phone for a couple of hours and go to sleep, all to earn fuck-all money, that you blow on booze and crap on the weekend cos all you want to do is live for yourself for a couple of days after living all week just to supply shelving so some rich cunts can get even richer.”

“But how would society work if we don’t do our jobs? We got to supply the shelving, Kevey. People need it.”

“Do they? Does someone fuckin die if there isn’t enough shelving in fucking Papakura Farmers? The world’s gonna stop fuckin turning if they can’t sell another set of hair straighteners because they don’t have a cream powder-coated alumnium shelving unit to display it on?”

Eggie was silent for a moment, a slight grimace on his face. I noticed he was taking short, sharp breaths, his nostrils flaring out at each outgassing. For a second I was worried I’d gone too far. I didn’t come here to destroy his whole socioeconomic worldview. I just wanted to know what happened on Saturday night when I somehow woke up in drag with a black eye.

“You asked,” I murmured.

“No. It’s OK. You told me what I need to know.” There was almost a sadness in his voice.

I thought he was going to walk off, but instead he bent down and began to wordlessly pick up the scattered shelving brackets from the floor. Mo joined him too and, after a moment of feeling really fuckin uncomfortable, I cracked and joined them too.

“Eh, boy, now you working for us for free! And I thought you hated the job!” Eggie let out one of his signature cackles at his own joke. I chuckled too, partly out of relief that the tension had been broken. I caught Mo’s eye for a moment, and he nodded and gave me a look that said yes, I get the shits having to listen to his shit jokes too, but I’ve learned to put up with it.

“What about you, Mo,” said Eggy as we put the last of the brackets in the box. “How come you come and work every day and no complaints?”

Mo shook the box to settle the brackets snugly into the box, then stood slowly.

“Here, I come to work, and I don’t think ‘is bomb coming? do I need RPG today?” He shrugged.

Fuck me, that was an uncomfortable bit of perspective. Me and Eggy tried to nod understandingly and hmmm empathetically. Mo looked unconvinced, and shuffled off with the box to find a lower shelf to place it on.

“Hey, Mo,” Eggy called after him. “After that, take an early smoko, eh? And take an extra ten minutes.”

“OK boss.”

“OK Kevey. Let’s go back to my office. You told me what I needed to know, now I tell you what I know.”

Thank fuck for that. We shuffled back to the disheveled office and sat back on either side of his desk, interview style.

“So, Kevey. You know my daugher Tilly, eh?”

“Yeah. So, she was with me on Saturday, right?”

“Yes boy. She said you were on another level to everyone that night. You were high on life. And drugs.” He grinned, and I braced myself for the cackle I thought was coming, but he suppressed it, and became serious again. “Well, I don’t know about the drugs or not, but apparently you were having a lot of fun. She said you ran into a hen’s party. They were seeing how many guys they could convince to swap underwear with them. You said you’d only do it if someone would swap all their clothes with you. So you did. With a very big girl. Tall. Big feet.”

“Oh, Jeez.” I shook my head. “Then what?”

“You went to Drexlers, and, ah, you kind of fell on your head. Just ... a accident. Tilly says you’re a good guy. Just want to have fun, not hurt anybody. And I want to say, I respect that. Nothing to be ashamed of. Young people need to have some fun sometimes.”

“Um ... OK. What about my phone?”

“Eh?”

“You said you could tell me where my phone is?”

“Oh. Nah. I must have just said that to get you to come here today.” He laughed in a much, much more muted way than usual.

“What a fucking waste of time,” I sighed, and got up to leave.

“Kevey, wait.” There was a crack of emotion in his voice, which stopped me in my tracks. “Look, Kevey, I got to tell you the real reason I wanted you to come here today. I need your help. I got a contract to deliver shelves next week, and it’s too much for just me and Mo to get done in time. Kevey, I could lose the business if I don’t make it. If I don’t deliver on time, I have to give the customer’s deposit back. I need that money. My cashflow is fucked. The bank could take my Mum’s house.”

“Your Mum’s  house?”

“Yeah. Mum bought a house in Grey Lynn when we moved from the Islands in the 70s. We mortgaged the house to but this business. How else do you think a coconut like me ends up running a business like this, eh?” He grinned.

“Uh... never thought about it, I guess.”

“Look, this is really serious, Kevey. It’s my last chance. My family is fucked if I don’t make this order on time next week.”

“You fuckin better not be making this up too, Eggy.”

“Hand on heart.”

“OK then, what do you want from me?”

“You work one week. One week only. I give you double your old wage. Cash. Winz doesn’t need to know.”

Fuck. It was actually tempting. I could use a few pingas. But, working here? Again?

“Geez... I dunno Eggy...”

“Don’t say nothing yet. There’s one more thing. Come, it’s for Mo too.”

He leapt up and strode to the smoko room, while I scurried to keep up. There we found Mo playing pool alone.

“Mo, Kevey. I have an offer for you. It might mean pulling some long hours, but if we get this job done on time for next week, I have something for you. You’ll own it, fifty fifty. Come, I show you.”

Eggy led us back to the workshop floor and over to one of the shelves, upon which sat a car battery charger plugged into a nearby electrical socket, with a dusty car battery hooked up to it. Eggy unclipped the charger from the battery terminals, picked the battery up, and held it out to us. We both stared at it for a moment.

“You ... you’re going to give us fifty percent shares in a car battery?”

“No, numbnuts. The car this goes in. Round the back. Guy who used to work here hated the job even more than you, didn’t even take his Holden when he took off. The battery went flat, but it’s charged now. Here. Go put it in, see how the car goes.”

Mo and I looked at each other. He shrugged, then stepped forward and took the battery. Eggy jingled around in a cavernous pocket for a moment, and then produced a single car key which he handed to me.

“Well, what are you waiting for. Go round the back and have a look.”

With that, we took off to the carpark round the back, Mo leading the way. We rounded the corner and looked for the car - “over there, in the back corner” Eggy pointed out.

There it was. It reminded me of a bouncer: decked out in jet black with a touch of shiny chrome, quiet but with a hint that there was some serious menace under the hood, and built like a fucking tank.

I walked up and opened the driver’s door, sat in the driver’s seat and engaged the bonnet release switch. Eggy opened the bonnet, then stepped back so Mo could place the battery in its housing and connect the terminals. When Mo was done, Eggy lowered then dropped the bonnet so it clicked to loudly, then gave me a nod. I nodded back, took a breath, then slid the key into the ignition and turned...

When turning the key in the Holden’s ignition barrel, before hitting the “start” position that would send the signal to the starter motor to initiate the internal combustion cycle, there was a brief moment when it passed though the “accessory” position, at which point the stereo came to life on whatever radio station it had last been set to, at top volume in the middle of a song, which just so happened to be Jimi Hendrix singing...

“... I gave her the gun ... I shot her!”

... after which the starter motor kicked in and, after a turning over a few times, managed to get the engine to roar into life, all 8 cylinders firing in harmony to produce a truly menacing growl, loud but not loud enough to drown out the stirring wail of the “Hey Joe” guitar solo.

For a moment I transcended the material world of the back carpark, the full-body experience of the car shuddering under me, the ludicrously overpowered engine yearning to break free of its yoke and roam free on the highways, the swell of the music, the old-engine burning oil smell seeping into the car through the air vents, all combining to send me into a trance-like state...

... time slowed ... the fade-out of the song seemed to stretch to eternity ...

... all was ephemeral ... the pain and boredom of life melted away in the moment ...

“... Jimi Hendrix there with Hey Joe, taking it waaaay back, and tell you what, this is taking me way back too: KFC is bringing the double down back! And boy, I remember when the first ever double down came out -”

I opened my eyes, turned the car off, and sat back in the driver’s seat. All I wanted was to drive this car the fuck out of here, forever. I sighed, and turned, suddenly noticing Eggy’s face right up against the window.

“You OK, Kevey?”

I nodded, took they key out of the ignition, and got out of the car.

“Well,” Eggy said in anticipation. “What do you think?”

“I’ll do it, but one condition. I get to drive the car to and from work this week.”

Eggy looked at Mo, who nodded.

“OK boy, you got a deal. Now stop fucking around with your car and get to work.” He cackled.

And so it was that I ended up back on the Precision Shelving workshop floor, doing the job I hated so much that I’d walked out and swore never to come back. I think the thing I hated as much as anything else was the sheer mindless boredom of the job. I thought that maybe if I daydreamed about disappearing in the Holden to a beach far, far away it would distract me from the painful drudgery of the job. I’m pretty good at daydreaming, but even for me that was a big ask.

One thing that helped was that we had a fuck ton of work to do, so I hardly had time to overthink things too much. Break times were tight; there was no point lingering in the break room because it just meant the work would take longer and you’d have to stay later. Lunchtime was a blur of wolfing down enough brown deep fried shit to stave off the ravenous hunger the work gave you. Mo was an eager convert to the kiwi pie; he’d have two for lunch. Afternoon smoko was a time to drink a cup of tea in silence, the three of us all a little shellshocked as we contemplated the amount of work ahead of us.

After the afternoon smoko on that first day, as me and Mo shuffled back to work, Eggy yelled at us from the other end of the workshop.

“Hey boys! When you’re done with those inserts, get started on cutting the board for the second box, eh?”

Hearing this, Mo muttered something that I couldn’t understand because it was in Afghanistan language or whatever the fuck they speak there, but if I had to guess I’d put good money that there were a few swearwords in what he said. He did not look happy. He breathed deeply, forced a kind of bared-teeth smile, then yelled back:

“OK, boss!”

He then proceeded to get back to his task of pushing plastic inserts into place with a kind of intense focus. I pondered for a moment, then wandered over to him.

“Hey, Mo.”

“Hmmm?” He didn’t look up.

“You said something before. Was that, like, your Afghanistan language or whatever.”

“Yes.”

“What language is that, anyway?”

“Pashti.”

“Pashti. Sweet. Um, just wondering ... what was it you said?”

“I ... I can’t tell you. It is too bad words.”

“Shit, for real. Eggy really pissed you off, eh?”

Mo stopped and looked up at me.

“He says wrong thing to do next. And I can’t tell him that.”

“Yeah? Why is it the wrong thing?”

“If we start on second box, it will get in way, make us slower. Is better to finish all of first box, then second.”

“Hey boys!” Eggy interrupted, yelling again from across the workshop. “Check it out!”

He was holding a two metre long roll of plastic wrap on his crotch, waving it around like a giant cock and cackling with laughter. Mo looked at me, shrugged, and went back to work.

And so we worked the rest of the day, Mo and I beavering away while Eggy did fuck knows what, in and out of the office, faffing about with various things far away from us, only interacting with us to crack a couple more shitty jokes. We were still going around sevenish when Eggy finally came over to us.

“OK boys, better be time to knock off, eh? Go home, have a good dinner and a good sleep, then we start again at seven tomorrow. Don’t forget to fill out your timesheet on the way out.”

“OK boss.”

Eggy was already walking off. Mo and I went to the office to fill out the 1B5 exercise book that served as Eggy’s timesheet system. I tried my best to wait patiently while Mo filled out his hours, but I’d been thinking about driving the Holden home all day. I impatiently fondled the car key in my pocket, caressing the edges of it like a Year 10 boy playing pocket billiards. As he finished up, a thought occurred to me.

“Hey, Mo. How’re you getting home?”

“I catch 670 bus to Otahuhu, then train to Manurewa.”
