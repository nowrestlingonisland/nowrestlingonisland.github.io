	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 7: Sandra seemed to come out of the whole double divorce drama smelling of roses.</h2>

	<p>
	  Sandra seemed to come out of the whole double divorce drama smelling of roses. I get the feeling Dad and Paul were kind of scared of the new, inexplicably calm and serene Sandra. I don't know exactly what they worked out, but Sandra seemed to do OK out of the deal, because pretty soon she bought this real fancy house in Freemans Bay.

	<p>
	  In some ways, the whole experience actually seemed to inject a whole new energy into her life. She hit it off with her new neighbour, who got her a job in advertising. It turned out she had a real natural aptitude for advertising, and she ended up making a ton of money in the industry. There was a brief period of presumed celibacy while she sorted out her new life, but after that she didn't ever seem to be wanting for romantic liasons, no doubt finding it even easier without the complications of sharing a house. But then, the hoarding started.

	<p>
	  At first, it wasn't really hoarding at all, it was just her getting all the stuff she needed for her new place. She was starting from nothing, having not taken any material possessions in her divorce settlements, so nobody batted an eyelid at her buying a bunch of new furniture and other accoutrements for her new place. Later, when she started making good money, we all thought it was natural that she'd spend some of it on nice things for herself. So we didn't see the hoarding coming - it was one of those things that built up gradually. For a while she'd even git rid of things from time to time, just never quite as much as she was bringing in.

        <p>
          It was probably five years later, when I was deep in the shittiest years of high school, that there was serious talk of it being a problem. One day after school Mum took me over to Sandra's to confront her. I was anxious as fuck on the way there, as the thought of a big shit-fight between the two of them seemed like the most excruciating thing possible to fourteen year old me. Luckily for me no showdown ended up happening, as Sandra turned out to have some sort of voodoo mind-control style immunity to being confronted about her hoarding, because - and to this day I can't quite put my finger on exactly how she pulled it off - not only did Sandra sidestep any confrontation regarding the whole hoarding issue, she also managed to talk Mum into taking a cheeky eccy, and staying up until dawn to go to the top of Maungawhau to watch the sun rise. That was the coldest I've ever been, curled up in foetal position on the wooden benches by the summit trig station, trying to stay out of the wind, unable to sleep while Mum and Sandra murmured and cackled, re-litigating every event of the last twenty years and bonding over it all again and hugging and ... Jesus, it was awful. The upshot of all of this was that Mum didn't question Sandra about her hoarding for another five years, instead just accepting who she was with love.

        <p>
          Well, that turned out to be a mistake...
