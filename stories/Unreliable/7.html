	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 7: Sandra seemed to come out of the whole double divorce drama smelling of roses.</h2>

	<p>
	  Sandra seemed to come out of the whole double divorce drama smelling of roses. I get the feeling Dad and Paul were kind of scared of the new, inexplicably calm and serene Sandra. I don't know exactly what they worked out, but Sandra seemed to do OK out of the deal, because pretty soon she bought this real fancy house in Freemans Bay.

	<p>
	  In some ways, the whole thing was quite good for her. She hit it off with her new neighbour, who got her a job in advertising. It turned out she had a real natural aptitude for advertising, and she ended up making a ton of money in the industry. There was a brief period of presumed celibacy while she sorted out her new life, but after that she didn't ever seem to be wanting for romantic liasons, no doubt finding it even easier without the complications of sharing a house. But then, the hoarding started.

	<p>
	  At first, it wasn't really hoarding at all, it was just her getting all the stuff she needed for her new place. She was starting from nothing, having not taken any material posessions in her divorce settlements, so nobody batted an eyelid at her buying a bunch of new furniture and other accoutrements for her new place.
