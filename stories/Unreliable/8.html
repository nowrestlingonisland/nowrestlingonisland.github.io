	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 8: Things started building up</h2>

	<p>
          Things started really building up, literally, at Sandra's house. Like, there ended up being these skyscrapers of junk stacked in every room, with alleys and walkways left between them to navigate around the nightmare cityscape her house eventually became. When you get sent all kinds of industry magazines all the time and you never throw them out, instead just continually stacking them on top of each other, it turns out that before you know it you need a step ladder to get to the top of the stack, and not long after you'll reach the limits of your standard 2.4 metre stud height and have to start a new skyscraper at the ground level somewhere else in the house.

        <p>
          Towards the end, things really accelerated. Like, we'd visit her after not seeing her for a couple of weeks, and half a room would be filled with new crap. In fact, on the day I was there with Mum and Seth to stage the intervention, it turned out in the last few weeks she'd developed a new obsession with vintage hi-fi gear, and we found we could barely get through the fron door before finding ourslves surrounded with the stuff. By this time she was hard-out into wheeling and dealing in the marekt for second-hand goods. She had a knack of picking a category, learning more about it than even the enthusiasts knew, and ruthlessly sniffing out deals on all of the best stuff. Of course this meant if you ever questioned her she could give you the entire back story on each and every item, how amazing it was and why it was a treasure, its unique place in history as the only model of blah with the rare blah blah component that could do blah blah blah... So most of the stuff she had she wasn't keeping for "crazy" reasons. Like, it wasn't like she was claiming that the apocolypse was coming and vintage hi-fi gear would somehow become the key to survival (though I'd totally read that sci-fi novel). Everything had a sane justification, it was just that there was so, so much of it. The finally, when Mum found out that Sandra had quit her job so she could concentrate on managing all her junk, well, that's when we got dragged into this whole second attempt at an intervention.

        <p>
          OK, well, I think that pretty much brings us back to where I started the whole story. I hope you paid attention because you really need to know all of it or the rest won't make sense. So yeah, there we were, in Aunty Sandra's house, surrounded by the huge collection of vintage hi-fi gear she had recently built up as part of her hoarding habit, trying to stage an intervention and ... well, I wasn't quite 100% on what Mum actually wanted to acheive out of the whole operation, but anyway I was there. And, while Mum had followed Sandra into another room to give her a good talking to, Seth and I got chatting, and that's when he told me about how he'd slept with Elton John's bass player "on accident," thinking he was a woman.

        <p>
          "Dude," I said, "you really like a challenge, don't you. Please do tell me exactly how this suprising to the point of unbelievable situation came about."

        <p>
          "Well, it all started when I was hanging out with my mate Lewis in the Grey Lynn RSC..."
