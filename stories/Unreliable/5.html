	<h2>Part 5: The fireworks</h2>
	<a href="/stories/Unreliable/4.html">Read part 4 here</a>

	<p>
	  When I first witnessed the fireworks between Dad and Sandra, it wasn't so bad - usually after the initial arguing-about-trivial-shit fireworks there would quickly follow remembering-our-passion-for-each-other fireworks, and I'd be sent to watch TV while they adjourned to the bedroom. But as time went on, there was less and less of the good kind of fireworks and more and more  of the bad kind.

	<p>
	  I couldn't ever really tell how the bad fireworks started. I'd be doing my own thing, oblivious to whatever discussion they were having, and suddenly I'd become aware of Sandra storming off out of the house. I'd peek out of the lounge window and see her out on the deck smoking, bringing a shaky teacup up to her mouth in between drags, while Dad would loudly stack the dishwasher with Radio Sport turned all the way up, or moodily take dirty clothes to the laundry. This attempt at cooling off never lasted long though. Soon enough one of them would have steamed on the disagreement enough that they couldn't handle it any more, and would have to go and make sure the other really understood their point of view, which would lead to seriously raised voices, and finally one of them would get the shits with the whole situation and bugger off into the night (or day).

	<p>
	  It was the times that Sandra was doing the storming off into the night that led to her becoming close to Mum. There were only a limited number of people she could try to go to for support. At first she'd try to go to Paul, but she found that he'd tend to take his brother's perspective. Bros before hoes, once again. In contrast, once she tried going to Mum, she found that after initially being hesitant Mum was soon all too keen to agree with her on Dad's faults. After a while, Sandra would just go straight to Mum's at the slightest sign of conflict with Dad, well before any sort of brouhah could kick off, like she was going to preemptively grumble about things he hadn't even said yet. At some points, it felt like Sandra was spending more time at Mum's than with Dad.

	<p>
	  The funny thing about Sandra is, that even though she was a one-man woman with Paul for over ten years, once she'd broken the seal on that it seemed that she realised she didn't really want to stick with any one person for too long. Once she realised she could play the field, she didn't want to give up the game. She was a bit like Grandma Lucy in that way - I sometimes wonder if that's why Dad and Paul were attracted to her, subconsciously at least, like some kind of genetic memory of polyandry. Anyway, after a while of things not being so great with Dad, Sandra just sort of started dating other people. She didn't break up with him, in fact she didn't even really talk to him much. She just started doing it.

	<p>
	  Dad was sort of oddly calm about it all, like he was relieved to be free of the Sandra storm. They didn't argue any more, and even though they didn't talk much they oddly enough still shared a bed when she was around. I guess there was a sort of comfort there?
          
	<p>
	  I was still mostly unphased by the whole situation. At first it was a little unexpected that Sandra was all of a sudden hanging out with a whole bunch of different people, but you soon get used to that sort of thing. And I was a little young to be fully aware of exactly what was going on. Seth reckons everyone knew that she was up to all sorts of stuff - like really expanding her horizons beyond the current societal sexual norms, if you know what I mean. This all went over my head at the time though. I mean, sure, all sorts of people of all genders were hanging out with her at various times and in various combinations, but my eleven-year-old mind didn't naturally leap to any conclusions. Seth reckons that once he even snapped Sandra in the bedroom with Mum and a third person having some grown-up playtime. I always figured that one was almost certainly bullshit, but who knows for sure?

	<p>
	  So yeah, Mum and Sandra actually ended up quite close when all was said and done. Then of course later on, Sandra ended up a lone hoarder. Yeah, quite a contrast, you're right. I guess I should explain that too...
