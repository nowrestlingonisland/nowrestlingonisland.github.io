	<h1>Unreliable: A tale of several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 1: It had been a rough day</h2>

<p>
It had been a rough day. 

<p>
Mum had guilted me into helping her stage this kind of creepy intervention to try and do something about Aunty Sandra’s hoarding. I mean, yeah, Sandra’s house was disturbing as fuck, with the stacks of stuff that she couldn’t ever plausibly need or use, and yeah, we all acknowledged that there was definitely a certain amount of nesting rats in there, but to my mind it was her life to live, and if that means living amongst piles of old crap and mouse nurseries, who are we to gang up on her and interfere? But I could tell that argument was more likely to make Mum turn all doe-eyed and bum me out than to get me out of it, so, as always, I ended up coming. At least she’d convinced my half-cousin Seth to come too, so I’d have him there to spin a few yarns to ease the boredom. And that day he told me what was probably the tallest in his long line of very tall tales: that he’s slept with Elton John’s bass player “on accident,” thinking he was a woman.

<p>
Yep, I was skeptical too. But I can never quite be a hundred percent skeptical with Seth. I’ll tell you the rest of his story - and believe me, it’s a doozy - but first I’ll tell you why you can’t ever fully dismiss his stories. For that, you’ll need to know a bit more about Seth.

<p>
  The weird thing about me and Seth, is that we’re not just half-cousins but step-siblings too, technically. This is just the sort of thing Seth loves to tell people, by the way. It’s outlandish enough that everyone suspects it’s bullshit when he tells them the story, but then I’ll turn up and confirm that it’s all true, and all of a sudden they’re wondering if any of the other outlandish shit he’s told them is true as well. I mean, at least ninety percent of his stories are pure bullshit, but then the ten percent that turn out to actually be real give a veneer of believability to the rest. So yeah, step-siblings as well as half-cousins. I guess I'd better explain how our family tree got into a bit of a tangle there. I promise there's no inbreeding.

<p>
  First, we were just half-cousins. How half-cousins? Well, me and Seth have the same grandmother: Grandma Lucy. Seth's dad, Paul was Grandma Lucy's son by her first husband, Art. My dad, Merv, was from her third marriage, with Aisi. So, me and Seth have the same grandma, different grandads, our dads are half-brothers, boom: we're half-cousins. Grandma Lucy only ever had the two kids, even though she was married eight times. All her husbands got on pretty well too, none of them were bitter about things. They all just seemed thankful that they had some time with Grandma Lucy. She was just that kind of lady, I guess.

<p>
  Seth was a couple of years older than me, and as a kid I totally looked up to him - I mean come on, a cousin who's a couple of years older and a boy, as a little girl I thought he was amazing. Our two families spent quite a bit of time together, which I guess makes total sense when both Mum and Dad and Uncle Paul and Aunty Sandra were trying to raise a couple of little annoying little toe-rags like me and Seth. That meant me and Seth spent a lot of time together, which gave him the perfect opportunity to calibrate his knack for lying convincingly. Up until I was seven or so I was almost totally unquestioning, pretty much taking everything he said as gospel. Then there was probably a year or so when I became gradually more and more skeptical, but I still didn't call him out on anything. But the first time I properly caught him in a lie, was at the pond...
