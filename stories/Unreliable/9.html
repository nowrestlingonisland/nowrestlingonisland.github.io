	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 9: You know my mate Lewis</h2>

	<p>
          "You know my mate Lewis, right? Welsh muso guy?"

        <p>
          "Yeah." It was true, I had met Lewis. He'd regaled me with tales of the series of second or third tier rock bands he'd toured with back in the UK. Names you'd vaguely heard of, but nobody big.

        <p>
          "Well, I met him on Tuesday after work for a beer, and he talked me into flower flipping."

        <p>
          "Flower what?"

        <p>
          "Flower flipping. Mushies and eccy at the same time. I know, I'd never heard of it either."

        <p>
          "Sounds intense."

        <p>
          "Fuckin eh. So there we were, in the corner of the Grey Lynn RSC, monged off our tits. He was telling me all these war stories of touring with the big names, and somehow it became like I was living the stories - I could see the things he decribed, feel the sensations he was talking about, like I was actually there. Fuckin tripping balls, transported to another time and place. But then he brings me right back to the here and now and says, 'Ah, here's Barry - he used to play bass for Elton John.'"

        <p>
          "And you thought Barry was a woman?"

        <p>
          "Nah, of course not - that came later. Anyway, next thing you know Lewis has talked Barry into flower flipping too. Then this tight as reggae band started playing, and of course we had no choice but to get up and absolutely tear the dance floor to pieces. The dance floor was absolutely out of control, there were joints everywhere ... I mean it seemd like that to us, anyway. And then we somehow ended up dancing with these three ladies who must've clocked in somewhere north of seventy.

        <p>
          "Oh god." I suddenly wasn't sure that I wanted Seth to finish painting this picture.

        <p>
          "Stay with me. After a bit Barry tapped out. I guess the drugs got a bit much and he just gapped it. I figured he'd gone to crash out. Anyway, me and Lewis are still partying with these three ladies, and the E started stimulating some urges. Well, things started getting hot and heavy and we decided we should all go and continue the party back at Lewis's place. Pretty much as soon as we got to his place he made his move on the youngest one out of the three and they headed to his room and so I'm left in the lounge with the other two. It didn't seem fair to leave one of them out of the fun, so I invited both of them to the spare bedroom. I decided we should keep the lights off, because ... well, y'know. Anyway, we hopped in the bed and there was a bit of fumble, bump and grind. Look, I was totally mashed so I wasn't a hundred percent aware of exactly what I was doing, but something definitely happened. Anyway, after the 'something' had happened, I was desperate for a piss, but when I got to the bathroom, one of the two ladies I thought I'd been in bed with was already there, asleep on the toilet. I was like, no way has she made it here before I did... So I went back to the bedroom, and sure enough, there's Barry in the bed next to the other lady. Turns out he'd been crashing at Lewis's while he was in town, and we'd just gatecrashed his bed. Not that he was complaining."

        <p>
          "So ... she was asleep on the toilet the whole time? ...and it was Barry in the bed with you? ...and you definitely...?"

        <p>
          "Look, I'm trying not to dwell on the details of what went on under the covers too much, y'know? But..." He shrugged.

        <p>
          "But what did... you know what, I don't want to know any more. But jeez, Seth, couldn't you have had a bit more self-control?"

        <p>
          "Hey, don't judge until you're off your tits and a couple of randy RSC hotties start flirting with you. You might crack, you know."

        <p>
          I was saved from answering by Aunty Sandra sweeping into the room, with Mum scurrying trying to keep up behind her. 

        <p>
          "Darlings, I've talked to Betty and we've agreed we won't be needing you today."

        <p>
          "No we haven't," puffed Mum.

        <p>
          "Well, you're welcome to stay of course, but I've explained to Betty that I have a fully-formed plan for restoring and selling on each of these items, with all profits to go to charity."

        <p>
          "Yes, but when?" pleaded Mum. "When are you going to actually do it?"

        <p>
          Sandra narrowed her eyes for a moment, and then broke out in a beaming smile.

        <p>
          "Well, why not now? I can see it's making you anxious, Betty, so if we can make a start on at least assessing things today, then we can be sure the ball is rolling. Why don't we start with these Aiwa stereo systems. They're all 1980s, should be worth a bit if we can find the right buyers. We need to make sure they all work first. Seth, grab that cardboard box of LPs and we can play one, make sure we can get a sound out of them."

        <p>
          "Woah," said Seth, pulling a record out of the box. "Upper Hut Posse. Where did you get that?"

        <p>
          "Well," said Sandra, "let me tell you a story about that."

        <p>
          And so that's how I ended up staying up until 4 AM, listening to hip-hop on vinyl on eighteen different 1980s stereo component systems, listening to my Mum and Aunty Sandra revealing way more about their love lives than I ever wanted to know while they smoked a fair bit, while splitting a cheeky tab of acid with my cousin Seth, who had scored it from Elton John's ex-bass player, who he'd inadvertently had a three-way with along with a lady in her seventies. See, if I hadn't told you the whole story, you never would've believed that, would you?
