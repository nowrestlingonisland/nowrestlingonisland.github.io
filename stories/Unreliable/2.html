	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 2: The pond</h2>
        <a href="stories/Unreliable/2.html">Read part 1 here</a>

	<p>
	  The pond was on Stephen's farm. Stephen was Grandma Lucy's husband number seven, and probably my favourite of her husbands. He had somehow made a ton of money with an internet printing business that none of us ever quite understood, and after selling up was able to spend his time basically LARPing as a farmer on a lifestyle block near Mangawhai. Me and Seth had gone there to stay for the summer school holidays while our parents came and went, doing parent-ey things while we got the farm experience.

	<p>
	  One afternoon, everyone except Stephen was out, and he was busy with a spanner somewhere underneath his Hilux, leaving me and Seth effectively unsupervised and free to wander barefoot through the tetanus-spangled paddocks. We soon came upon the pond, a twenty-metre wide body of semi-stagnant water, rumoured to be home to several species of scary-looking exotic fish.

	<p>
	  "I've swum to the bottom of that before," Seth claimed, poker-faced as always.

	<p>
	  "Oh, real? What's down there?"

	<p>
	  "A big, bad Moray eel. Teeth big enough to take your arm off. Scary dude. I swum right back out of there, too scary for me."

	<p>
	  "No way! I'm gonna check it out." With that I started stripping off.

	<p>
	  "Eh? Nah, it's too dangerous - Patty!"

	<p>
	  Before he could stop me, I was naked and diving straight into the middle of the pond, disappearing under the water. I swum down, desperately holding my breath for as long as I could handle, and then a bit more, before erupting out of the water and gasping:

	<p>
	  "Holy shit, you're right! I saw it! Did you see how it's got that gold bracelet stuck around it?"

	<p>
	  "Yeah? Yeah! Crazy, eh?"

	<p>
	  And with that tacitly agreed lie, I guess I somehow signed up to go along with Seth's bullshit, at least for as long as it was fun. But there's a bit more I still need to tell you more about the family.

	<p>
	  As you can tell, in those early years our families were pretty close, and even as half-cousins, me and Seth were probably closer than many siblings are. But then tragedy struck, and the happy dynamic suffered a shock. Seth's parents split up; Sandra left Paul to go on a boat trip with a certain someone, ostensibly to protest the blood diamond trade off the coast of Africa (they never made it even half that far, but I'll tell you more about that in a bit).

	<p>
	  But soon enough it turned out that maybe this wasn't so tragic after all, and that maybe there would be a way for some people involved to be even happier than before...
