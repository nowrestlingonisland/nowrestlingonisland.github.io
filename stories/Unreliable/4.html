	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 4: Dad was initially hesitant</h2>
	<a href="/stories/Unreliable/3.html">Read part 3 here</a>

	<p>
	  Dad was initially hesitant to follow Mum's advice to go and see if Sandra needed help - I mean, literal bros before hoes and all that - but eventually he gave in to her pressure and ended up driving to Wellington to give her some emotional support. Turns out he was all too good at giving emotional support; he and Sandra ended up hooking up while he was down there, and after a few days they drove back and appeared at our door holding hands, sheepishly telling Mum that they'd found a new lease on love together, and was it OK if they stayed at ours for a bit while they found a new place together?

	<p>
	  Mum wasn't too receptive of their request. In fact, she tore them a new one and sent them packing. They then apparently went off to try their luck with Paul. Seth says that when they arrived, Paul had been smoking "special cigarettes" with a "close male friend" he'd earlier that week. After an initial freakout, Paul evidently realised that his life was immensely improved without Sandra and that he held no ill-will to either of them. He welcomed them with open arms, and the four of them stayed up chatting until 4AM, during which time Seth snuck three joints and five glasses of brandy, and played Playstation until dawn unnoticed.

	<p>
	  Anyway, I think you can see where I'm going with this - long story short, Dad and Sandra had a whirlwind romance resulting in an expedited divorce and a registry office wedding (with yours truly attending in her best jeans and Lakers shirt, holding a sad bunch of Countdown roses), and, hey-presto, the half-cousins were now also half-siblings. You do remember that I was explaining how that came about, right? Look, you're going to need to keep up a bit better if I'm going to get to the end of this whole thing.

	<p>
	  Soon after this Dad and Sandra got their own place, and for a while this meant Seth and I would bounce around three different households depending on which combo of parents was in responsbile for us. My mind boggles at the logistics now, but at 11 I didn't need to worry about any of that, and to be honest I actually loved it. Seth and I knew how to get the most out of every different place we stayed at, milking adults for treats and staying up late left, right and centre.

	<p>
	  Anyway, so now you've got the background on me and Seth, back to the original story: there we were, the two half cousins "slash" half siblings, at Aunty Sandra's among her many, many stacks of hoarded items, with Seth telling me all about how he'd accidentally had sex with Elton John's bass player thinking he was a woman. "But we had a laugh about it afterwards," Seth hastened to add. "Like the time I accidentally came on my mate Davo - weird at first, but then we saw the funny side."

	<p>
	  I know what you're wondering: how come my Mum wanted to help Sandra out so bad when she'd basically ended her relationship with Dad? Well, I guess I'll just have to tell you the rest of their story to explain that.

	<p>
	  You see, Dad and Sandra pretty soon started having issues. Pretty much every time I was at their place, there would be fireworks, and not always the good kind...
