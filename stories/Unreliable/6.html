	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 6: The story of how Sandra eventually became a lone hoarder</h2>

	<p>
	  The story of how Sandra eventually became a lone hoarder can probably be traced back to when Dad finally hooked up with someone else. I guess it was inevitable that it would happen sooner or later; it couldn't be one-way traffic forever. It must be said that it was kind of hypocritical of Sandra to get jealous when it happened, given that she'd been playing the field (and the one next to it, and the one across the road, and any other fields she could find, and, well, any patch of grass she came across really). That said, given the particular way it happened I can kind of see her side - in a way. Long story short, Dad hooked up with Sandra's Mum, Jean, and Sandra caught the two of them in flagrante in her and Dad's marital bed. It would of been something of a shock. (What? Yeah, would've been. Would have. That's what I said, isn't it?)

	<p>
	  I suppose Sandra's non-discriminatory dating practices weren't such a surprise when you considered that in many ways she was a chip off Jean's block. Jean had also apparently exhausted her quota of monogamy on her first husband at a relatively young age, and after they split she never seemed to have any trouble finding a date. It seemed like every time I saw her she had a different bloke on her arm, usually quite suave, well-dressed, successful types. Fuck knows what she saw in Dad - on the face of it he was quite a step down compared to her usual tastes. Maybe the thrill of the forbidden? Maybe flirting with getting caught turned her on? Still a mystery to me, to be honest.

	<p>
	  Anyway, maybe when Sandra caught her Mum and her technically-still-husband in the throes of passion it made her think about her own life - had she turned into her mother? - or maybe seeing her own behaviour reflected back at her by her own flesh and blood freaked her out - whatever it was, something inside her kind of snapped. Like, seriously snapped. She disappeared for ten days, no one knows where to, and was finally found wandering a beach like a castaway, mumbling incoherently. She was then taken to Mum's house, where she slept for ten more days. I snuck in to peek at her a few times, checking if she was still alive, or seeing if she was faking it all and actually secretly playing candy crush on her phone. But she was just completely out to it, breathing really quietly and reeeeally slowly. At the ten day mark, she appeared from her room while we were eating breakfast, looking really calm and happy, totally silent but with this kind of zen half-smile on her face.

	<p>
	  We tried to ask her questions but she didn't seem to register any of them. Instead she made and ate about ten rounds of toast with jam, a look of complete serenity on her face the entire time, then wandered off outside. Me and Mum followed her in case she was going to disappear again. But no, she just walked straight to Dad's place, and when he answered her knock on the door, she calmly told him she wanted a divorce. All he could do was nod, shocked. Then she walked back to our house to phone a lawyer, us following her the whole time, gawking like morons.

	<p>
	Now, the whole divorce thing could've got complicated - I mean, Sandra hadn't even completely sorted out dividing up the property her and Paul still co-owned, given their divorce had really only gone through recently. But we were surprised at how quickly things seemed to get sorted, and what it meant for Sandra...
