	<h1>Unreliable: A tale in several parts</h1>
	<h2>Part 3: After the initial shock</h2>

	<p>
	  After the initial shock, it became apparent that Paul and Sandra's breakup wasn't so tragic after all; in fact, before long it seemed everyone was actually happier than before. Paul was left in sole charge of Seth while Sandra was at sea, but was able to avoid much of the stress of solo parenting by not overly concerning himself with the responsibilities of parental supervision. In addition, he quickly adapted to his newly single status by spending time with a series of gentleman friends, sometimes entertaining them at home, and sometimes making house calls, often with Seth in tow. This presented a thirteen year old Seth with the opportunity to explore the possibilities of a series of different houses, each with its own set of books, games, snacks, liquor cabinets, and sometimes weed stashes, all of which he was increasingly adept at taking advantage of.

	<p>
	  Sometimes Paul needed to be unencumbered by his son for a stretch, so Seth would come and stay with us. This was even more fun than hanging with Seth when we were little, as Seth in his new life of minimal adult supervision had learned a whole new paradigm for making your own fun. More than once he led me on a nighttime tour of the neighbourhood via roofs and fences, usually culminating in a raid on the bin out the back of the local bakery. To an eleven year old, free day-end donuts were a special kind of ecstasy.

	<p>
	  Other times, Paul would recriprocate the childcare favour and have me to stay with him and Seth. There was always a weird smoky, meaty, sweaty smell to their house when you first walked in, but that soon faded into the subconscious, especially as I was usually co-opted straight away into a game of Fifa. We'd always have frankfurters, sauerkraut, carrots, and tomatoes for tea. This would be followed by ice cream for the kids while Paul did the dishes, and then we'd all watch movies on the couch until we fell asleep and then moved to our respective sleeping spots.

	<p>
	  Those were good times. I'm digressing a bit though. I should come back to Sandra, and what happened when she came back from her boating odyssey "On Da Sea". (That's ... actually what they called the boat, I shit you not. Besides being a terrible name, it was confusing as fuck as a kid to hear your parents say "waddaya reckon the motion of the ocean is On Da Sea?" and then crack up for minutes on end. I spent way too long trying to untangle what on earth that meant, all for a shitty parent pun.)

	<p>
	  It turned out Sandra and her paramour's incipient relationship had hit the rocks after a couple of weeks on the boat together. I mean, all they did was go from barely knowing each other to living in each other's pockets while they navigated the vast loneliness of the open ocean, with no posibble escape from each other, all in pursuit of a cause that they seemed to have just discovered the day before they decided to go. Who would've guessed that wouldn't work out? Anyway, the end result was that Sandra was back on dry land some months before she was due. Lips were tight about exactly what happened on the sea, but suffice to say Sandra immediately disappeared to stay with a friend in Wellington for a while, a move she claimed was to give her space to think but which looked suspiciously like she was clearing off for a while to let the dust settle on the whole caper.

	<p>
	  Mum seemed real worried about Sandra, and kept telling Dad he should be trying to see if she needed help, seeing as she was his sister-in-law, the mother of his nephew and all. She probably didn't quite expect what that help would entail...
